    [ Available also at: https://omega8.cc/node/381 ]

  This BOA release opens a new era in SSL support for all hosted Drupal sites.
  The old method of creating SSL proxy vhosts is officially deprecated,
  as explained in the docs/SSL.txt how-to:

  NOTE ###===>>>

  The old how-to is still useful if you prefer to use SSL termination separated
  from your Aegir system, or if you don't want to use built-in Letsencrypt.org
  SSL certificates support (available since BOA-3.1.0).

  But if you can use Letsencrypt.org SSL certificates, or you are willing to use
  also built-in BOA feature which allows you to replace Letsencrypt.org SSL
  certificate with any third-party certificate per site, while still managing SSL
  via Aegir control panel (for redirects, forced/required SSL mode), we highly
  recommend to use Aegir built-in SSL support, which is enabled and ready to use
  in all Octopus instances since BOA-3.1.0 release.

  NOTE ###===>>>

  * How it works?

    BOA leverages letsencrypt.sh utility to talk to Letsencrypt.org servers,
    and on the Aegir side it's using new `hosting_le` extension, which replaces
    self-signed SSL certificates generated by Aegir with Let's Encrypt ones.
    You can find more information on both at these URLs:

      https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh
      https://github.com/omega8cc/hosting_le

  * How to add Letsencrypt.org SSL certificate to hosted site?

    In your Aegir control panel please go to the site's node Edit tab, then
    under `SSL Settings > Encryption` choose either `Enabled` or `Required`,
    if you want to enable HTTP->HTTPS redirection on the fly. Now click `Save`
    and wait until you will see the Verify task completed. Done!

    NOTE: SSL Settings are not available in the Add Site form, only in Edit.

  * How to add Letsencrypt.org SSL certificate to the Aegir Hostmaster site?

    !!! WARNING
    !!! ###===>>> Don't enable SSL option for the Hostmaster site in Aegir
    !!! WARNING

    Let’s Encrypt SSL for Aegir control panel is handled in BOA outside of
    the control panel, and you should never enable it within control panel.

    During octopus upgrade you will see this message, explaining what to do:

      BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: Letsencrypt SSL initial mode: DEMO
      BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- No real SSL certs will be generated
      BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- To enable live SSL mode, please delete file:
      BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- /data/disk/o1/tools/le/.ctrl/ssl-demo-mode.pid
      BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- Then run octopus forced upgrade

  * How to modify/renew Letsencrypt.org SSL certificate for SSL enabled site?

    When you modify aliases or redirections, Aegir will re-create the SSL
    certificate on the fly, to match current settings and aliases to list.

    BOA runs auto-renewal checks for you weekly, and forces renewal if there is
    less than 30 days to the certificate expiration date (Let’s Encrypt certs
    are valid for up to 90 days before they have to be renewed).

    Also every Verify task against SSL enabled site runs this check on the fly.

  * Are there any requirements, limitations or exceptions?

    Yes, there are some:

    * All aliases must have valid DNS names pointing to your server IP address
    * Even with aliases redirection enabled all aliases are listed as SAN names
    * Avoid renaming SSL-enabled sites; move aliases between site's clones instead
    * Before you rename a site, disable SSL first; then re-enable once it's renamed

    NOTE: The Subject Alternative Names (SAN) is a feature which allows to issue
    multi-domain / multi-subdomain SSL certificates -- it is automated in BOA.

    Let's Encrypt API for live, real certificates has its own requirements
    and limits you should be aware of. Please visit their website for details:

      https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

    To make this new BOA feature easy to test before you will be ready to
    generate real, live SSL certificates, BOA comes with Let's Encrypt demo
    mode enabled by default, so it will not hit limits enforced for live,
    real Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. It allows to generate "fake" certs,
    similar to self-signed certificate used in BOA by default.

    NOTE: All sites with one or more keywords (listed below) in the site's
    main name (this exception rule doesn't apply to aliases) will be ignored,
    and they will receive only self-signed SSL certificates generated by Aegir,
    once you will switch their SSL settings to `Enabled` or `Required`.

      `.(dev|devel|temp|tmp|temporary|test|testing|stage|staging).`

    Examples: `foo.temp.bar.org`, `foo.test.bar.org`, `foo.dev.bar.org`

    NOTE: This exception rule doesn't apply to aliases which are not used
    as a redirection target. Even aliases with listed special keywords in their
    names will be listed as SAN entries, as long as they are valid DNS names.

  * How to enable live mode?

    It is enough to delete the `[aegir_root]/tools/le/.ctrl/ssl-demo-mode.pid`
    control file and run Verify task on any SSL enabled site again.

    NOTE: If you are on hosted BOA, you don't have an access to this location
    on your system, so please open a ticket at: https://omega8.cc/support

    You could switch it back and forth to demo/live mode by adding and deleting
    the control file, and it will re-register your system via Let's Encrypt API,
    but we have not tested how it may affect already generated live certificates
    once you will run the switch many times, so please try not to abuse
    this feature.

    It is important to remember that once you will switch the Let's Encrypt mode
    to demo from live, or from live to demo, by adding or removing the
    `[aegir_root]/tools/le/.ctrl/ssl-demo-mode.pid` control file, it will not
    replace all previously issued certificates instantly, because certificates
    are updated, if needed, only when you (or the BOA system for you during its
    daily maintenance, if used) will run Verify tasks on SSL enabled sites.

    These BOA specific Verify tasks are normally scheduled to run weekly,
    between Monday and Sunday, depending on the first character in the site's
    main name, so both live and demo certificates may still work in parallel
    for SSL enabled sites until it will be their turn to run Verify and update
    the certificate according to currently set Let's Encrypt mode.

    NOTE: You may find some helpful details in the Verify task log -- look for
    lines with `[hosting_le]` prefix.

  * How to replace Let's Encrypt certificate with custom certificate?

    1. Create an empty control file (replace `example.com` with your site name):

       `[aegir_root]/tools/le/.ctrl/dont-overwrite-example.com.pid`

    2. Replace `privkey.pem` symlink with single file containing your custom
       certificate key -- use `privkey.pem` as a filename in the directory:

       `[aegir_root]/tools/le/certs/example.com/`

    3. Replace `fullchain.pem` symlink with single file containing your custom
       certificate and all intermediate certificates beneath it -- use
       `fullchain.pem` as a filename in the same directory:

       `[aegir_root]/tools/le/certs/example.com/`

    4. Run Verify task for your site in the Aegir control panel. Done!

    NOTE: If you are on hosted BOA, you don't have an access to this location
    on your system, so please open a ticket at: https://omega8.cc/support


  ###
#-### Support for PHP-FPM version switch per Octopus instance (also per site)
  ###

  ### ~/static/control/fpm.info
  ###
  ### This file, if exists and contains supported and installed PHP-FPM version,
  ### will be used by running every 2-3 minutes system agent to switch PHP-FPM
  ### version used for serving web requests by this Octopus instance.
  ###
  ### IMPORTANT: If used, it will switch PHP-FPM for all Drupal sites
  ### hosted on the instance, unless multi-fpm.info control file also exists.
  ###
  ### Supported values for single PHP-FPM mode which can be written in this file:
  ###
  ### 7.0
  ### 5.6
  ### 5.5
  ### 5.4
  ### 5.3
  ###
  ### NOTE: There must be only one line and one value (like: 7.0) in this file.
  ### Otherwise it will be ignored.
  ###
  ### It is now possible to make all installed PHP-FPM versions available
  ### simultaneously for sites on the Octopus instance with additional
  ### control file:
  ###
  ### ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info
  ###
  ### This file, if exists, will switch all hosted sites to highest
  ### available PHP-FPM version within the 5.3-5.6 range, with ability
  ### to override PHP-FPM version per site, if the site's name is listed
  ### in this additional control file, as shown below:
  ###
  ### foo.com 7.0
  ### bar.com 5.5
  ### old.com 5.3
  ###
  ### NOTE: Each line in the multi-fpm.info file must start with main site name,
  ### followed by single space, and then the PHP-FPM version to use.
  ###


  ###
#-### Support for PHP-CLI version switch per Octopus instance (all sites)
  ###

  ### ~/static/control/cli.info
  ###
  ### This file, while similar to fpm.info, if exists and contains supported
  ### and installed PHP version, will be used by running every 2-3 minutes
  ### system agent to switch PHP-CLI version for this Octopus instance, but
  ### it will do this for all hosted sites. There is no option to switch this
  ### or override per site hosted.
  ###
  ### NOTE: While current Aegir version 3.x included in BOA works fine with
  ### latest PHP 7.0, many hosted sites, especially using Pressflow 6 core or
  ### older Drupal 7 core without required patch we have included since 7.43.2,
  ### will not work properly and Aegir tasks run against those sites may fail,
  ### so it's recommended to use PHP-CLI 5.6, unless you have verified that all
  ### sites on the instance support PHP 7.0 without issues.
  ###
  ### Supported values which can be written in this file:
  ###
  ### 7.0
  ### 5.6
  ### 5.5
  ### 5.4
  ### 5.3
  ###
  ### There must be only one line and one value (like: 5.6) in this control file.
  ### Otherwise it will be ignored.
  ###


  ###
#-### Support for forced Drush cache clear in the Aegir backend
  ###

  ### ~/static/control/clear-drush-cache.info
  ###
  ### Octopus instance will pause all scheduled tasks in its queue, if it will
  ### detect a platform build from the makefile in progress, to make sure
  ### that no other running task could break the build.
  ###
  ### This is great, until there will be a broken build, and Drush will fail
  ### to clean up all leftovers from its .tmp/cache directory, which in turn
  ### will pause all tasks in the queue for up to 24-48 hours, until the cache
  ### directory will be automatically purged by running daily cleanup tasks,
  ### designed to not touch anything not old enough (24 hours at minimum)
  ### to not break any running builds.
  ###
  ### If you need to unlock the tasks queue by forcefully removing everything
  ### from the Aegir backend Drush cache, you can create an empty control file:
  ### ~/static/control/clear-drush-cache.info
  ###
  ### You have to delete this file once the tasks queue is unlocked again,
  ### or it will forcefully clear Drupal cache on every run, which in turn will
  ### break all future attempts to build the platform from makefile via Aegir
  ### control panel interface.
  ###


  ###
#-### BOA can run Debian Wheezy to Debian Jessie upgrades easily
  ###

  This feature works like it worked before for `_LENNY_TO_SQUEEZE=YES` and then
  for `_SQUEEZE_TO_WHEEZY=YES`. But make sure you follow all the steps exactly
  as listed below:

  1. Upgrade both barracuda and octopus to current stable:

    $ cd;wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt;bash BOA.sh.txt
    $ barracuda up-stable
    $ octopus up-stable all both

    NOTE: You can upgrade octopus selectively, if you still need one running
    the old stable BOA-2.4.9 version, example:

    $ octopus up-2.4 o1 force
    $ octopus up-stable o2 force
    $ octopus up-stable o3 force

  2. Add to your /root/.barracuda.cnf this line:

    _WHEEZY_TO_JESSIE=YES

  3. Run another barracuda upgrade with command:

    $ barracuda up-stable

  4. If there are no errors reported, try to run manual update:

    $ aptitude update
    $ aptitude full-upgrade

    It should tell you that there are no packages to upgrade left.

  5. Reboot your system (preferably via remote console)

    $ reboot

  6. Run barracuda upgrade again:

    $ barracuda up-stable

  7. Try to run manual update:

    $ aptitude update
    $ aptitude full-upgrade

    It should tell you that there are no packages to upgrade left.

  8. Congrats! You are running BOA stable on Debian Jessie.

  This BOA release includes complete Aegir 3 with Drush 8, and introduces
  full support for latest Drupal 8.0.5 and Drupal 8.1.0-beta2 as custom
  platforms you can create in the ~/static directory tree.

  @=> BOA will not include built-in Drupal 8 platforms until Drupal 8 will
      support symlinks in the codebase, like all previous core versions.

  @=> All supported Aegir platforms have been updated to their latest releases

  @=> Octopus Aegir instances hosted on Power Engine option will *not* receive
      upgrade to BOA-3.x unless requested via https://omega8.cc/support
      to prevent issues with (often) customized Hostmaster modules not ready
      for Drupal 7 based Aegir control panel. All hosted BOA systems will still
      continue to receive the Barracuda system upgrades.

  @=> It is possible to host previous stable BOA-2.4.9 Octopus instances
      on systems with Barracuda upgraded to BOA-3.0.0

# Known problems:

  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/milestones/3.0.1

  While clean 3.0.0 install worked in our tests before the release, it doesn't
  work for others. Until this problem is fixed properly without regressions,
  we are switching boa installer back to 2.4.9, which makes getting 3.0.0
  on initial installation a two step operation: first 'boa in-stable' install
  to get 2.4.9, and then 'barracuda up-stable' plus 'octopus up-stable' upgrade
  to get 3.0.0, because upgrades for barracuda and octopus from 2.4.9 to 3.0.0
  work fine.

  This also means that 'boa in-octopus' will still install the legacy 2.4.9
  octopus extra instances, and you can upgrade them to 3.0.0 with standard
  'octopus up-stable' mode.

  It is still possible to test/debug boa 3.0.0 clean installs -- just create
  an empty /root/.debug-boa-installer.cnf file before running the installer.

### Stable BOA-2.4.7 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Fri Dec  4 08:09:21 PST 2015
### Milestone URL: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/milestones/2.4.7
### Latest hotfix added on: Thu Dec 10 10:10:26 PST 2015

  @=> Includes Aegir Hostmaster 2.x-head with improvements
  @=> Includes Aegir Provision 3.x-head with improvements
  @=> Includes Drush 7 customized for BOA

# Release Notes:

  This BOA release includes several important system upgrades and bug fixes,
  with most notable features and changes listed below.

  @=> All supported Aegir platforms have been updated with latest Drupal cores

  @=> Drupal 8 support for custom platforms in the ~/static directory tree
      will be included, along with Drush 8 and PHP 7 in the *upcoming*
      BOA-3.0.0 release: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/milestones/3.0.0

  @=> This BOA release (2.4.7) is the last release which still supports
      deprecated PHP versions: 5.3 and 5.4 -- You should switch to PHP 5.6
      or at least 5.5 as soon as possible, or you will not be able to upgrade
      to newer BOA versions after 2.4.7 -- https://omega8.cc/node/330

  @=> What are BOA plans for Drupal 6 support after February 24th, 2016?

      We will support Drupal/Pressflow 6 in all new releases, as long as
      available PHP versions will allow to use it (we run our own Pressflow 6
      based site on PHP 5.6 for many months with zero issues). For more details
      please check: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/issues/824

  @=> SSH keys for root are required by newer OpenSSH versions used in BOA

      BOA installs SSH from sources by default (Debian only). This means that
      password based access for root will not work once BOA is installed or
      upgraded to current stable version. It is a result of OpenSSH changes
      in recent releases and not BOA specific change. BOA will deny the initial
      install and Barracuda will refuse to run upgrade if it detects that system
      root has no SSH keys added and only password based access is available.
      You can still modify this behaviour in /usr/etc/sshd_config but future
      OpenSSH versions may still revert such changes, so it is not recommended.

  @=> BOA switched from SPDY to HTTP/2 + PFS on all supported OS versions

### Stable BOA-2.4.5 Release - Full Edition

### Milestone URL: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/milestones/2.4.5

  @=> Includes Aegir Hostmaster 2.x-head with improvements
  @=> Includes Aegir Provision 3.x-head with improvements

# Release Notes:

  This BOA release includes PHP security upgrade for versions 5.6, 5.5 and 5.4
  plus security upgrade for Redis server and four updated Octopus platforms.

  Support for Drupal 8 is temporarily removed, because now it would require
  an upgrade to Drush 8, which in turn completely removes support for PHP 5.3,
  while it's still more important to support legacy Pressflow 6 sites, if they
  are not ready to move beyond PHP 5.3 yet, than trying to support some
  (too fast) moving targets like Drupal 8 beta, and Drush 8 head.

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  Commerce 2.26 ---------------- https://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart
  Commons 3.28 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/commons
  OpenAtrium 2.43 -------------- https://drupal.org/project/openatrium

  * PHP 5.4.43
  * PHP 5.5.27
  * PHP 5.6.11

### Stable BOA-2.3.8 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Sat Nov 29 09:58:45 SGT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-head with improvements

# Release Notes:

  This new BOA release includes new features, improvements and bug fixes.

#-### Support for optional Drupalgeddon daily checks on all hosted D7 sites

  ~/static/control/drupalgeddon.info

  Previously enabled by default, now requires this control file to still
  run daily, because it may generate some false positives not always possible
  to avoid or silence, so it no longer makes sense to run this check daily,
  especially after BOA has run it automatically for a month and finally even
  disabled automatically all clearly compromised sites.

  Note that your system administrator may still enable this with root level
  control file /root/.force.drupalgeddon.cnf, so it will still run, even
  if you will not create the Octopus instance level empty control file:
  ~/static/control/drupalgeddon.info

  Please note that current version of Drupalgeddon Drush extension needs
  the 'update' module to be enabled to avoid even more false positives,
  so BOA will enable the 'update' module temporarily while running this
  check, which in turn will result with even more emails notices sent
  to the site admin email, if these notices are enabled.

#-### Support for automated BOA upgrades: weekly and one-time

  You can configure BOA to run automated upgrades to latest stable version
  for both Barracuda and all Octopus instances with three variables, empty
  by default. All three variables must be defined to enable auto-upgrade.
  You can set _AUTO_UP_MONTH and _AUTO_UP_DAY to any date in the past
  if you wish to enable only weekly system upgrades.

  Remember that one-time upgrades will include complete upgrade to latest BOA
  stable for Barracuda and all Octopus instances, while weekly upgrade is
  designed to run only 'barracuda up-stable system' upgrade.

  _AUTO_UP_WEEKLY= #------ Day of week (1-7) for weekly system upgrades
  _AUTO_UP_MONTH= #------- Month (1-12) to define date of one-time upgrade
  _AUTO_UP_DAY= #--------- Day (1-31) to define date of one-time upgrade

  All three variables should be added in your /root/.barracuda.cnf file.

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  ERPAL 2.2 -------------------- https://drupal.org/project/erpal

# New features and enhancements in this release:

  * Support for automated BOA upgrades: weekly and one-time.

# Changes in this release:

  * Drupalgeddon daily checks on all hosted D7 sites are now optional.

# Fixes in this release:

  * Issue #508 - The _EASY_HOSTNAME is not required in local install mode.

#-### Support for locking/unlocking web server write access in all codebases

  This new, auto-enabled by default protection will enhance your system
  security, especially for sites in custom platforms you maintain
  in the ~/static directory tree.

  It is important to understand that your web server / PHP-FPM runs as your
  shell/ftps user, although with a different group. This allows to maintain
  virtual chroot for Octopus instances, which significantly improves security.

  However, it had a serious drawback: the web server had write access in all
  your platforms codebases located in the ~/static directory tree, because
  all files you have uploaded there have the same owner.

  While it allows you to use code management which requires web hooks, it also
  opens a door for possible attack vectors, like for the infamous #drupageddon
  disaster, where Drupal allowed attackers to create .php files intended
  to be used as backdoors in future attacks - inside your codebase.

  Even if it could affect only custom platforms you maintain in the ~/static
  directory tree, since all built-in Octopus platforms always had Drupal core
  completely write-protected, plus, even if created by attacking bot, these
  extra .php files are completely useless for attackers, because BOA default
  restricted configuration doesn't allow to execute not whitelisted, unknown
  .php files, having codebase writable by your web server is still dangerous,
  because at least theoretically it may open a possibility to overwrite valid
  .php files, so they could be used as an entry point in a future attack.

  BOA now protects all your codebases by reverting (daily) ownership on all
  files and directories in your codebase (modules and themes) so they are
  owned by the Aegir backend user and not your shell/ftps user.

  While this new default procedure protects all your codebases in the ~/static
  directory tree, and even in the sites/all directory tree, and even in the
  sites/foo.com/modules|themes tree in all your built-in Octopus platforms,
  you can still manage the code and themes with your main and extra shell
  accounts as usual, because your codebase is still group writable, and your
  shell accounts are members of the group not available for the web server.

  You can easily disable this default daily procedure with a single switch:

    ~/static/control/unlock.info

  You can also exclude any custom platform you maintain in the ~/static
  directory tree from this global procedure by adding an empty skip.info
  control file in the given platform root directory, so all other platforms
  are still protected, and only excluded platform is open for write access
  also for the web server. But normally you should never need this unlock!

  Please note that this procedure will not affect any platform if you have
  the non-default _PERMISSIONS_FIX=NO setting in your /root/.barracuda.cnf
  file. It will also skip any platform with fix_files_permissions_daily
  variable set to FALSE in the given platform active INI file.

  five required _AWS_* variables in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file and run the
  special command 'backboa install' while logged in as root.

  To restore any file from backups created with 'backboa' tool, you can use
  the same script on the same or any other BOA server.

### Stable BOA-2.3.4 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Wed Oct 15 09:51:08 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.1 with improvements

  Release Notes and changelog for BOA-2.3.4 has been merged into BOA-2.3.5
  above after security upgrades related to OpenSSL and SSLv3 have been added
  shortly after 2.3.4 release.


### Stable BOA-2.3.3 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Sat Sep 27 01:25:46 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.1 with improvements

# Release Notes:

  This BOA Edition includes important fixes to address some issues discovered
  after BOA-2.3.1 release. Please read also the release notes for BOA-2.3.1
  further below before running the upgrade!

#-### Important details on CiviCRM versions compatibility and profiles support

  * All BOA-2.3.x Editions fully support latest CiviCRM 4.5.0 for Drupal 7.
  * CiviCRM for Drupal 6 is not supported because of known CiviCRM issues.
  * CiviCRM support for Drupal 7 works great when added in sites/all/modules
  * CiviCRM support for Drupal 7 also works when added in profiles/foo/modules
    but no CiviCRM cron is currently managed until this known issue is fixed,
    therefore BOA-2.3.3 will check all platforms on the Octopus instance and if
    it will detect any with CiviCRM added in the installation profile directory
    tree, it will refuse to upgrade such instance to not break things for those
    using currently not fully supported CiviCRM codebase structure.

### Stable BOA-2.3.2 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Thu Sep 18 15:16:33 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.1 with improvements

  Release Notes and changelog for BOA-2.3.2 has been merged into BOA-2.3.3
  above after several hotfixes and various updates have been added shortly
  after 2.3.2 release to address all identified post-release issues.


### Stable BOA-2.3.1 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Sun Sep 14 15:53:25 SGT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.1 with improvements
### Latest hotfix added on: Mon Sep 15 19:10:07 SGT 2014

# Release Notes:

  This major BOA Edition introduces many new features, changes and fixes.

  You should carefully read about some caveats further below **before** running
  this major upgrade on your system. Please secure a fresh system backup first.

  If you haven't run full barracuda+octopus upgrade to latest BOA Stable
  Edition yet, don't use any partial/system upgrade modes.

  Once new BOA Stable is released, you must run *full* upgrades with commands:

  $ cd;wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt;bash BOA.sh.txt
  $ barracuda up-stable
  $ octopus up-stable all both

  @=> Key new features:

  * BOA-2.3.1 comes with new, shiny Aegir 2.1 stable version!
  * Support for Drupal sites in subdirectories is enabled by default
  * Solr 4 cores can be added/updated/deleted via site level INI settings
  * Super-easy to use New Relic support with per Octopus license key
  * Ability to add new Octopus instances with new, simple command syntax

  @=> Aegir control panel new features:

  * The list of sites is searchable by name or installation profile
  * Sites have dedicated tabs: Backups, Task log, Edit and Packages
  * Platform have tabs: Add site, Clients, Task log, Edit and Packages
  * You can schedule tasks against filtered sites in batches
  * Scheduling tasks in batches is available also on the platform view
  * Scheduling tasks in batches is available also on the profile view
  * Scheduling tasks in batches is available also on the client view
  * You can schedule tasks also against platforms in batches
  * You can safely apply db updates via 'Run db updates' task on any site
  * The new 'Clients' menu item allows to list and manage sub-accounts
  * Profiles are listed with both human-readable and machine names
  * It is now possible to choose any existing alias or the main site name
    as a redirect target, but without the need to rename the site --
    it will just re-verify the site and create new vhost automatically

  @=> Aegir control panel changes:

  * The hosting/signup form is still available but not included in the menu
  * The node/add/site form is no longer included in the main menu
  * The optional pseudo-CDN-aliases feature is now disabled by default

  @=> Other important changes:

  * Support for PHP 5.2 has been officially deprecated
  * The www53 PHP-FPM pool has been switched from port to default socket mode
  * All existing vhosts must use wildcard in the Nginx 'listen' directive
  * Legacy mode for Install and Upgrade moves to 2.2.x branch
  * DB credentials are no longer in settings.php, only in drushrc.php
  * Latest Drush 6 version is used in the Aegir backend by default

  But what if you are not ready for this major upgrade and you would like
  to have more time for testing, but still be able to run system upgrades,
  thus effectively still using previous version 2.2.9 ?

#-### Legacy mode for Install and Upgrade moves to 2.2.x branch

  From now on, the 'legacy' install and upgrade mode available in all meta-
  installers will utilize branch 2.2.x instead of deprecated 2.1.x series.

  This means that starting with meta installers updated to use BOA-2.3.1
  version you can use commands like shown below to update Barracuda, Octopus
  and also to install more Octopus instances, while still using version 2.2.9:

  $ boa in-legacy public server.mydomain.org my@email o1
  $ barracuda up-legacy system
  $ octopus up-legacy o1
  $ boa in-legacy public server.mydomain.org my@email o2 mini
  etc.

  Remember to update your meta-installers first!

  $ cd;wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt;bash BOA.sh.txt

  Note also that if you will upgrade to current 'stable', it is not possible
  to downgrade back to the 'old stable' with 'legacy' mode, so please proceed
  with care!

  Remember also that current legacy version will not receive any further
  updates, even for security issues (besides those provided as packages by
  your OS vendor - Debian or Ubuntu, which will still work), because it is
  already different enough from current 2.3.1 stable, so we can't reliably
  maintain both with working upgrade path.

#-### Caveats: This upgrade will force wildcard in the Nginx 'listen' directive

  If you have old enough BOA system which still uses legacy IP mode and not
  a wildcard in the Nginx 'listen' directive, which is both Aegir and BOA
  standard for a long time already, this upgrade will fix the problem and
  update directives only in vhosts known and controlled by BOA.

  If you have any other vhosts, located in standard or non-standard Nginx/BOA
  directories for vhosts, you have to update them manually after upgrade to
  BOA-2.3.0 or newer, or they will take over all other vhosts on the system
  and cause redirects to /install.php which results with Nginx error 403 or 404,
  depending on the prior configuration.

  It will happen because IP based 'listen' directive in Nginx has higher
  priority, and will mess things horribly if there are vhosts using wildcard
  and some using the main system IP address.

  What and how to replace? Here are the commands you need to run as root:

    $ sed -i "s/.*listen.*:80;/  listen  \*:80;/g" /path/to/vhost.file
    $ service nginx reload

  Note: this **doesn't** affect special vhosts for SSL enabled sites, if used,
  because they are designed to use IP based 'listen' directives to provide
  separation between SSL enabled IPs and their associated certificates,
  while their associated 'upstream' block may even point to either local or
  remote IP address, so there is no wildcard to use in this case, and it will
  not conflict with all other vhosts managed by Aegir, because all SSL enabled
  vhosts listen on other IP addresses than the main system IP, which is
  by default used by all vhosts with wildcard in the 'listen' directive.

  The problem may happen only when you have vhosts using wildcard and also
  some vhosts using **main** system IP address in the 'listen' directive,
  which may happen also unintentionally during upgrade to BOA-2.3.0 or never,
  if there are either vhosts BOA doesn't control, or there are ghost vhosts
  not yet purged if you didn't upgrade to BOA-2.2.9 before, or there are
  some disabled sites, so their vhosts will not be re-created by Aegir
  during this major upgrade (because only active sites can be re-verified).

  While BOA will fix also any such ghost vhosts anyway, it will not be able
  to detect and fix vhosts outside of the standard directories managed by Aegir.

#-### Ability to add new Octopus instances with new, simple command syntax

  It is now possible to add stable Octopus instances w/o forcing Barracuda
  upgrade, plus optionally with no platforms added by default -- usage:

    $ boa {in-octopus} {email} {o2} {mini|max|none}

#-### The www53 PHP-FPM pool has been switched from port to default socket mode.

  Note that we are breaking backward compatibility here, so it will cause
  downtime on upgrade from any too old BOA version, until you will upgrade also
  Octopus instance(s) and update any other non-standard vhosts or includes
  still using legacy port mode for 'fastcgi_pass' Nginx directive.

  If you have 'fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9090;' in any custom vhost or Nginx
  include file on the Octopus instance, you should replace it with:

    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/o1.fpm.socket;

  where 'o1' is your corresponding Octopus system username.

  Note that if you have custom vhosts or includes in the Aegir Master Instance,
  you should instead replace 'fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9090;' with:

    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/www53.fpm.socket;

  where '53' is related to PHP version defined via _PHP_FPM_VERSION in your
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file. Note that while variable has a dot, the socket
  name doesn't.

#-### Support for PHP 5.2 has been officially deprecated

  While Barracuda 2.3.1 can continue to run and even upgrade if needed also
  the very old PHP 5.2 version, only Octopus instances running at least PHP 5.3
  or newer in both FPM and CLI mode can be upgraded to Octopus 2.3.1 Edition.

  If you are still using PHP 5.2 in your Octopus instance, you will not
  receive Aegir nor Drupal Platforms upgrade, but the Barracuda part of your
  system will receive upgrade to 2.3.1 anyway, so it will be ready to support
  your outdated Octopus instance upgrade as soon as you will switch it to
  modern and secure PHP version -- which is easy!

  Let's quote the original how-to for reference:

#-### Support for PHP FPM/CLI version safe switch per Octopus instance

  This allows to easily switch PHP version by the instance owner w/o system
  admin (root) help. All you need to do is to create ~/static/control/fpm.info
  and ~/static/control/cli.info file with a single line telling the system
  which available PHP version should be used (if installed): 5.5 or 5.4 or 5.3

  Only one of them can be set, but you can use separate versions for web access
  (fpm.info) and the Aegir backend (cli.info). The system will switch versions
  defined via these control files in 5 minutes or less. We use external control
  files and not any option in the Aegir interface to make sure you will never
  lock yourself by switching to version which may cause unexpected problems.

#-### Support for New Relic monitoring with per Octopus instance license key

  This new feature will disable global New Relic monitoring by deactivating
  server-level license key, so it can safely auto-enable or auto-disable it
  every 5 minutes, but per Octopus instance -- for all sites hosted on
  the given instance -- when a valid license key is present in the special
  new ~/static/control/newrelic.info control file.

  Please note that valid license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string
  that New Relic provides when you sign up for an account.

  To disable New Relic monitoring for the Octopus instance, simply delete
  its ~/static/control/newrelic.info control file and wait a few minutes.

  Please note that on a self-hosted BOA you still need to add your valid
  license key as _NEWRELIC_KEY in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file and run
  system upgrade with at least 'barracuda up-stable' first. This step is
  not required on Omega8.cc hosted service, where New Relic agent is already
  pre-installed for you.

#-### Solr 4 cores can be added/updated/deleted via site level INI settings

;;
;;  This option allows to activate Solr 4 core configuration for the site.
;;
;;  Only Solr 4 powered by Jetty server is available. Supported integration
;;  modules are limited to latest versions of either search_api_solr (D7 only)
;;  or apachesolr (will use Drupal core specific version automatically).
;;
;;  Currently used versions are listed below:
;;
;;    http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/search_api_solr-7.x-1.6.tar.gz
;;    http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/apachesolr-7.x-1.7.tar.gz
;;    http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/apachesolr-6.x-3.0.tar.gz
;;
;;  Note that you still need to add preferred integration module along with
;;  any its dependencies in your codebase since this feature doesn't modify
;;  your platform or site - it only creates Solr core with configuration
;;  files provided by integration module: schema.xml and solrconfig.xml
;;
;;  This setting affects only the running daily maintenance system behaviour,
;;  so you need to wait until next morning to be able to use new Solr 4 core.
;;
;;  Once the Solr core is ready to use, you will find a special file in your
;;  site directory: sites/foo.com/solr.php with details on how to access
;;  your new Solr core with correct credentials.
;;
;;  The site with enabled Solr core can be safely migrated between platforms,
;;  integration module can be moved within your codebase and even upgraded,
;;  as long as it is using compatible schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files.
;;
;;  Supported values for the solr_integration_module variable:
;;
;;    apachesolr
;;    search_api_solr
;;
;;  To delete existing Solr core simply comment out this line.
;;  The system will cleanly delete existing Solr core next morning.
;;
;;  IMPORTANT if you are using self-hosted BOA: _MODULES_FIX=YES must be set
;;  in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file (this is default value) to make this
;;  feature active.
;;
;solr_integration_module = your_module_name_here

;;
;;  This option allows to auto-update your Solr 4 core configuration files:
;;
;;    schema.xml
;;    solrconfig.xml
;;
;;  If there is new release for either apachesolr or search_api_solr, your
;;  Solr core will not be automatically upgraded to use newer schema.xml and
;;  solrconfig.xml, unless allowed by switching solr_update_config to YES.
;;
;;  This option will be ignored if you will set solr_custom_config to YES.
;;
;solr_update_config = NO

;;
;;  This option allows to protect custom Solr 4 core configuration files:
;;
;;    schema.xml
;;    solrconfig.xml
;;
;;  To use customized version of either schema.xml or solrconfig.xml, you need
;;  to switch solr_custom_config to YES below and if you are using hosted
;;  Aegir service, submit a support ticket to get these files updated with
;;  your custom versions. On self-hosted BOA simply update these files directly.
;;
;;  Please remember to use Solr 4 compatible config files.
;;
;solr_custom_config = NO

### Stable BOA-2.3.0 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Mon Sep  8 08:42:01 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.1 with improvements

  Release Notes and changelog for BOA-2.3.0 has been merged into BOA-2.3.1
  above after several hotfixes and some great new features have been added
  shortly after 2.3.0 release to address all identified post-release issues.


### Stable BOA-2.2.9 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Wed Aug  6 17:08:10 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.
### Latest hotfix added on: Fri Aug 15 09:37:04 PDT 2014

# Release Notes:

  This release includes updated versions of all supported Drupal platforms to
  provide latest Drupal 7 and Pressflow 6 core, plus some changes, improvements,
  bug fixes, and many updated Octopus platforms.

  NOTE: Since the first Edition in the BOA-2.3.x series is not ready for release
  yet, and new Drupal core has been released to fix security issues, followed
  by yet another release to fix serious regressions, followed by yet another
  security release, we have decided to make it available to everyone and release
  yet another stable BOA-2.2.x Edition.

  IMPORTANT! This is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series, which marks the end
  of Drupal 5, PHP 5.2 and Drush 4 support. Next Edition will open 2.3.x series,
  which will allow us to provide newer Aegir version with built-in Drush 6
  support, sites in subdirectories, and many Aegir User Interface improvements.

  If you still host any Drupal 5 sites or you are using PHP 5.2 for D6 sites,
  you will not be able to upgrade to the next 2.3.x Edition and you will have to
  stay on the 'legacy' BOA 2.2.x version, which will receive only system
  security upgrades, but no further feature nor bugfix releases.

  This also means that from now on the 'legacy' 2.2.x version will no longer
  receive Drupal core upgrades, even if there will be security core releases.

  It is time to upgrade away from Drupal 5 and away from PHP 5.2, if still used.

### Stable BOA-2.2.7 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Thu Jul 17 03:11:47 CEST 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.
### Latest hotfix added on: Fri Jul 18 18:21:40 CDT 2014

# Release Notes:

  This release includes some nice new features, improvements, bug fixes, one
  new Octopus platform, five (5) updated Octopus platforms, along with latest
  Drupal core security upgrades for all supported platforms.

  NOTE: Since the first Edition in the BOA-2.3.x series is not ready for release
  yet, and new Drupal core has been released today to fix security issues,
  we have decided to make it available to everyone and release yet another
  stable BOA-2.2.x series Edition.

  IMPORTANT! This is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series, which marks the end
  of Drupal 5, PHP 5.2 and Drush 4 support. Next Edition will open 2.3.x series,
  which will allow us to provide newer Aegir version with built-in Drush 6
  support, sites in subdirectories, and many Aegir User Interface improvements.

  If you still host any Drupal 5 sites or you are using PHP 5.2 for D6 sites,
  you will not be able to upgrade to the next 2.3.x Edition and you will have to
  stay on the 'legacy' BOA 2.2.x version, which will receive only system
  security upgrades, but no further feature nor bugfix releases.

  This also means that from now on the 'legacy' 2.2.x version will no longer
  receive Drupal core upgrades, even if there will be security core releases.

  It is time to upgrade away from Drupal 5 and away from PHP 5.2, if still used.

### Stable BOA-2.2.6 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Sat Jun 21 06:14:18 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.
### Latest hotfix added on: Mon Jul 14 14:54:04 CDT 2014

# Release Notes:

  This release includes great new features, improvements, important changes,
  many bug fixes, plus 3 new and 7 updated Octopus platforms.

  IMPORTANT! This is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series, which marks the end
  of Drupal 5, PHP 5.2 and Drush 4 support. Next Edition will open 2.3.x series,
  which will allow us to provide newer Aegir version with built-in Drush 6
  support, sites in subdirectories, and many Aegir User Interface improvements.

  If you still host any Drupal 5 sites or you are using PHP 5.2 for D6 sites,
  you will not be able to upgrade to the next 2.3.x Edition and you will have to
  stay on the 'legacy' BOA 2.2.x version, which will receive only system
  security upgrades, but no further feature nor bugfix releases.

  This also means that from now on the 'legacy' 2.2.x version will no longer
  receive Drupal core upgrades, even if there will be security core releases.

  It is time to upgrade away from Drupal 5 and away from PHP 5.2, if still used.

# New Octopus platforms:

  aGov 1.0-rc8 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/agov
  ERPAL 2.0-b2 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/erpal
  Restaurant 1.0-a5 ------------ https://drupal.org/project/restaurant

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  Commerce 2.15 ---------------- https://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart
  Commons 2.18 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/commons
  Commons 3.14 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/commons
  Guardr 1.5 ------------------- https://drupal.org/project/guardr
  Open Atrium 2.19 ------------- https://drupal.org/project/openatrium
  Open Outreach 1.7 ------------ https://drupal.org/project/openoutreach
  Panopoly 1.6 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/panopoly

# New features and enhancements in this release:

  * Drush aliases based workflows are now supported also remotely over SSH.

    This is significant improvement since we have added automatically generated
    and updated Drush aliases for the on-the-server use in BOA-2.2.0

  * Add gems: compass_radix v2 and compass_twitter_bootstrap
  * Add support for automatic Scout App upgrade on RVM/Ruby/Gems upgrade.
  * Install headless JRE and only if Solr is expected to run.
  * Issue #2268889 - Allow to whitelist IPs for chive, cgp and sqlbuddy access.
  * Issues #2248907 #1299526 - Allow to use comments for admin notes.
  * Nginx: Disable proxy_buffering to avoid useless extra layer in local proxy.
  * SQL: Allow to change InnoDB log file size via _INNODB_LOG_FILE_SIZE variable
  * Use better subdirectory tree for Drush extensions.
  * Add support for disable_user_register_protection INI variable on the
    platform level - on self-hosted BOA and Power Engines only.

  * Issue #2240277 - Customize Octopus platforms list via control file.

    ~/static/control/platforms.info

    This file, if exists and contains a single line with supported platforms
    symbols, allows to control/override the value of _PLATFORMS_LIST variable
    normally defined in the /root/.${_USER}.octopus.cnf file, which can't be
    modified by the Aegir instance owner with no system root access.

    IMPORTANT: If used, it will replace/override the value defined on initial
    instance install and all previous upgrades. It takes effect on every
    future Octopus instance upgrade, which means that you will miss all newly
    added distributions, if they will not be listed also in this control file.

    Supported values which can be written in this file - remember: all in a
    single line, space separated, so not one per line, as listed below
    only for readability:

    # D7P D7S D7D --- Drupal 7 prod/stage/dev
    # D6P D6S D6D --- Pressflow 6 p/s/d
    # AGV ----------- aGov
    # CME ----------- Commerce v.2
    # CS7 ----------- Commons 7
    # DCE ----------- Commerce v.1
    # DCS ----------- Commons 6
    # ERP ----------- ERPAL
    # FSR ----------- Feature Server
    # GDR ----------- Guardr
    # MNS ----------- Managing News
    # OA7 ----------- Open Atrium D7
    # OAM ----------- Open Atrium D6
    # OAY ----------- Open Academy
    # OBG ----------- OpenBlog
    # OCH ----------- OpenChurch
    # ODS ----------- Open Deals
    # OOH ----------- Open Outreach
    # OSR ----------- OpenScholar
    # PPY ----------- Panopoly
    # RER ----------- Recruiter
    # RST ----------- Restaurant
    # SRK ----------- Spark
    # TTM ----------- Totem
    # UC7 ----------- Ubercart D7
    # UCT ----------- Ubercart D6

    You can also use special keyword 'ALL' to have all available platforms
    installed, including newly added in the future BOA system releases.

    Examples:

      ALL
      D7P D6P OAM MNS OOH RST

  * Issue #314 - Make _BACKEND_ITEMS configurable via _BACKEND_ITEMS_LIST

    You can whitelist extra binaries to make them available for web server
    requests, in addition to already whitelisted, known as safe binaries.

    NOTE: This feature is available only on self-hosted BOA systems.

    Please be aware that you could easily open security holes by whitelisting
    commands which may provide access to otherwise not available parts of
    the system, because the exec() in PHP doesn't respect other limitations
    like open_basedir directive.

    You should list only filenames, not full paths, for example:

      _BACKEND_ITEMS_LIST="git foo bar"

# Changes in this release:

  * Add memcache, memcache_admin to the list of automatically disabled modules.
  * Add support for Debian Squeeze LTS updates.
  * Add support for Debian Squeeze Stable Proposed Updates.
  * Add varnish to the list of automatically disabled modules.
  * Add watchdog_live to the list of automatically disabled modules.
  * Disable and remove not used init scripts on known VM systems.
  * Drush: Upgrade command line version 6 to mini-6-21-06-2014
  * Fast DNS Cache Server (pdnsd) install is no longer optional.
  * Install only vanilla core platforms by default (can be overridden)
  * Nginx: Update default limit_conn settings.
  * Nginx: Use only newer control file to force DoS monitor aggressive mode.
  * Sync permissions with new defaults in the hardened setup.
  * Update files ownership to match defaults in the hardened setup.
  * Use dynamic mirror selection provided by Debian instead of forced static.

  * The BOA project has moved to Github!

    We no longer use repositories and issue queues on drupal.org, in an effort
    to avoid fragmentation and duplication. We have moved all downloads used
    by Barracuda and Octopus to our mirrors a few months ago, and it helped to
    make BOA faster and more reliable during both system install and upgrades.

    The next step is to use http://boa.readthedocs.org as a new home for all
    future documentation efforts - it will build the docs, including printable
    versions, on the fly, using dedicated Github repository as a backend, where
    you can help migrate existing docs and improve them, both via boa-docs
    project issue queue and pull requests:

      https://github.com/omega8cc/boa-docs

    We also encourage you to use drupal.stackexchange.com for BOA support:

      http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aegir

    Please use our Github project for contributing code, reporting bugs,
    and also suggesting new features and ideas:

### Stable BOA-2.2.5 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Thu May  8 11:59:23 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.
### Latest hotfix added on: Sat May 10 09:05:19 PDT 2014

# Release Notes:

  This release includes no new features, but does include bug fixes plus latest
  Drupal 7.28.1 and Pressflow 6.31.2 core in all built-in Octopus platforms.
  There are also three updated distributions included, as listed below.
  We also list here all hot-fixes applied to previous stable after its release.

# Important - Read This First! (for self-hosted BOA only)

  If you haven't run full barracuda+octopus upgrade to latest BOA Stable
  Edition yet, don't use any partial upgrade modes explained in docs/UPGRADE.txt
  Once new BOA Stable is released, you must run *full* upgrades with commands:

  $ barracuda up-stable
  $ octopus up-stable all both

  For silent, logged mode with email message sent once the upgrade is
  complete, but no progress is displayed in the terminal window, you can run
  alternatively, starting with screen session to avoid incomplete upgrade
  if your SSH session will be closed for any reason before the upgrade
  will complete:

  $ screen
  $ barracuda up-stable log
  $ octopus up-stable all both log

  Note that the silent, non-interactive mode will automatically say Y/Yes
  to all prompts and is thus useful to run auto-upgrades scheduled in cron.

  If you have skipped some recent BOA releases, and you have new default config
  option: _PERMISSIONS_FIX=NO in your /root/.barracuda.cnf configuration file,
  plus, you are not sure if you follow best practices for managing permissions
  as recommended in our docs: https://omega8.cc/node/116 then we recommend
  that you change it to _PERMISSIONS_FIX=YES temporarily, or even permanently
  if your VPS is fast enough, and then run this powerful script as root:

  $ bash /var/xdrago/daily.sh

  Note that BOA 'legacy' mode is still at version 2.1.3

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  Commons 3.12 ----------------- https://drupal.org/project/commons

  * PHP 5.4.28
  * PHP 5.5.12

  * PHP: Fix for CVE-2014-0185 privilege escalation in FPM (doesn't affect BOA)
  * Postfix: Force re-install if broken permissions detected on upgrade.
  * Pressflow 6: Fix #GH 84 by using drupal_page_is_cacheable().
  * Pressflow 6: Merge pull request #GH 85 from pressflow/SA-CORE-2014-002-fix.
  * Pressflow 6: Remove duplicate openid_update_6001().

  * Set the TERM env variable if missing to avoid errors.
  * Skip packages set on hold when running apticron.
  * The ~/static/control must be writeable by lshell user to manage ctrl files.

### Stable BOA-2.2.2 Release - Barracuda Edition
### Date: Tue Apr  8 07:24:18 PDT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  This is a bug-fix only release to address issues discovered after recent
  major BOA-2.2.0 and subsequent BOA-2.2.1 Releases.

  The most important problem fixed in this Release is related to known OpenSSL
  security issue, which has been fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1g

  To learn more please visit: http://heartbleed.com

  @=> Note for those on self-hosted BOA (skip this if you are on a hosted Aegir)

  We recommend that you enable _SSL_FROM_SOURCES=YES option in your system
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file, to always build latest OpenSSL from sources.
  Note that it will also trigger OpenSSH and cURL install from sources, plus
  subsequent PHP rebuild to include latest SSL libraries.

  Note that _SSL_FROM_SOURCES=YES will not force the build from sources on
  Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu Precise, to avoid confirmed conflicts and because
  both OS versions already provide custom, patched OpenSSL packages.

  This Release doesn't include any updates to the Octopus installer, so there is
  no point in running full upgrade. It is enough to run the barracuda only,
  system upgrade in the "silent mode" with:

  $ screen
  $ barracuda up-stable system

  The system will send you an email with results when the upgrade is complete,
  but there will be no upgrade progress displayed in the console. You can watch
  it, if you prefer, with command (DATE/TIME are placeholders for real values):

  $ tail -f /var/backups/reports/up/barracuda/DATE/barracuda-up-DATE-TIME.log

# System upgrades in this release:

  * Nginx 1.5.13
  * OpenSSL 1.0.1g (if installed from sources)
  * PHP 5.4.27
  * PHP 5.5.11

# Fixes in this release:

  * Chive Authentication via SSH session may break Nginx due to race conditions.
  * Drush specific dt() wrapper is required in Provision for custom platforms.
  * Fix Compass Tools support for Omega (gems dependencies via bundle install).
  * Fix default shell for system level cron tasks.
  * Fix for csf firewall compatibility test.
  * Force better health check on protected vhosts on live SSH-auth update.
  * Improved health check for protected vhosts during live SSH-auth update.
  * Issue #2229555 - On fresh boa install link missing durring install.
  * Issue #2229715 - Tasks queue doesn't work on the Master Instance.
  * Issue #2231093 - Add new line before 'UseDNS no' in the sshd_config file.
  * Issue #2235991 - Drush make needs better exceptions in websh wrapper.
  * Issue #294 - New Relic ext not installed even if _NEWRELIC_KEY is not empty.
  * Nginx: Backup and re-create default wildcard SSL cert/key with rsa:4096
  * Nginx: Generate 4096 bit long DH parameters when _NGINX_FORWARD_SECRECY=YES
  * Normalize localhost entry in /etc/hosts to avoid FQDN mapped to 127.0.0.1
  * PHP: Better default workers limits for the ondemand mode.
  * PHP: max_input_time should be set to 180 and not 60, by default.
  * PHP: Zend OPcache directive opcache.enable=1 must be set in all ini files.
  * Reset PATH to avoid RVM overrides after Compass Tools install/upgrade.
  * The 'scp' command is broken in limited shell.
  * Too broad whitelisting breaks commands in limited shell with 'tmp' keyword.
  * Too restrictive open_basedir defaults break access to valid PEAR paths.
  * Too restrictive open_basedir defaults break access to valid Tika paths.
  * Use rsa:4096 by default in self-signed certs for Nginx and FTPS.


### Stable BOA-2.2.1 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Tue Apr  1 10:28:45 SGT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  This is a bug-fix only release to address issues discovered after recent
  major BOA-2.2.0 Release.

# Fixes in this release:

  * Chive Authentication via SSH session doesn't work on some older instances.
  * Compass Tools don't use correct paths to Ruby 2.1.1
  * Cron for sites doesn't work on old instances without Nginx wildcard vhost.
  * FTPS (FTP over SSL) connections may experience TLS problems.
  * PHP: Disabled 'assert' may cause warnings on features revert.
  * PHP: Disabled 'create_function' may break some contrib modules or code.
  * The 'git pull' command is broken in limited shell.
  * The 'rsync' command is broken in limited shell.
  * The 'drush dl foo' command can't be run outside of site directory.

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to BOA-2.2.1 (and 2.2.0) releases

  ==> Updated on Tue Apr  8 01:26:47 PDT 2014

  @=> Issues fixed in BOA head (running the hotfix in stable is enough):

  * Chive Authentication via SSH session may break Nginx due to race conditions.
  * Drush specific dt() wrapper is required in Provision for custom platforms.
  * Issue #2229715 - Tasks queue doesn't work on the Master Instance.
  * PHP: max_input_time should be set to 180 and not 60, by default.
  * The 'scp' command is broken in limited shell.
  * Too broad whitelisting breaks commands in limited shell with 'tmp' keyword.
  * Too restrictive open_basedir defaults break access to valid Tika paths.
  * Zend OPcache directive opcache.enable=1 must be set in all php.ini files.

  To fix all those problems you can run as root on self-hosted system:

  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa221fix.txt
  $ bash boa221fix.txt

  We have fixed this on all hosted and remotely managed Aegir instances already.

  @=> Other issues fixed in BOA head (run 'barracuda up-head system' to apply):

  * PHP: New Relic extension not installed even if _NEWRELIC_KEY is not empty.
  * Too restrictive open_basedir defaults break access to valid PEAR paths.


### Stable BOA-2.2.0 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Mon Mar 31 06:44:08 SGT 2014
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  There are many important changes and improvements in this release
  you should be aware of *before* running your BOA system upgrade.

  Even if you are on a hosted BOA system with upgrades managed for you,
  it is very important to read at least this extensive release notes.

  Here is a list of topics covered in detail further below:

  * New 'legacy' mode available for installs and upgrades
  * Important Note For Those Using Our Hosted Aegir Service!
  * Custom php.ini protection has changed and will not honor old settings
  * Barracuda no longer supports Percona since 2.2.0 release
  * Support for PHP FPM/CLI version safe switch per Octopus instance
  * All PHP FPM workers in 5.5, 5.4 and 5.3 now use the 'ondemand' mode
  * Drush aliases are now automatically copied to all relevant accounts
  * Drush is now restricted to use only trusted modules installed by default
  * The ~/.drush and other important directories and symlinks are protected
  * Support for safely configurable cache bins exceptions in Redis
  * Two-Factor-like Authentication to protect access to Chive DB Manager
  * Support for session.cookie_lifetime configurable via INI files
  * Support for files permissions-fix exceptions via platform level INI file
  * High-performance JavaScript callback handler (js) in all platforms

  And if you are more curious, read also the big changelog further below,
  which covers only a small number of over 560 commits since BOA-2.1.3 release.

  But what if you are not ready for this major upgrade and you would like
  to have more time for testing, but still be able to run system upgrades,
  thus effectively still using previous version 2.1.3 with standard command
  'barracuda up-stable system', as explained in the docs/UPGRADE.txt?

#-### New 'legacy' mode available for installs and upgrades

  We are introducing special 'legacy' mode both for BOA installs and upgrades.

  This means that starting with BOA-2.2.0 you can use commands like:

  $ boa in-legacy public server.mydomain.org my@email o1
  $ barracuda up-legacy system
  $ octopus up-legacy o1
  etc.

  These special 'legacy' commands allow you to install and/or upgrade the 'old
  stable', once the 'new stable' is released. But only until another 'stable'
  is released, of course. Thus you can use it only as an interim solution
  if you are not yet ready for latest 'stable' BOA Edition, for any reason,
  but you want to update at least the low level system packages, kernel etc.

  Note also that if you will upgrade to current 'stable', it is not possible
  to downgrade back to the 'old stable' with 'legacy' mode, so please proceed
  with care!

  This option will be particularly important once we release *next* major BOA
  Edition. It will come with terminated support for Drush 4, Drupal 5 and, yes,
  PHP 5.2 (finally). This step is required to use latest Drush 6+ with supported
  Drupal cores versions and supported PHP versions, which in fact is required
  to introduce the real Aegir 2.0 in BOA -- we are still using older, customized
  for backward compatibility, Aegir 2 HEAD version, so it is time to move on and
  stay up to date with everything, get new features like ability to manage
  Drupal sites in subdirectories etc.

  Once that *next* major BOA Edition is released, we will freeze the 'legacy'
  mode at 2.2.x series level, which will receive only security upgrades and
  no further feature nor bugfix releases. At that point you will have to stick
  to the 'legacy' BOA version if you will need to run PHP 5.2 and Drupal 5
  with Aegir based on Drush 4. It will be still possible, but not recommended
  and not really supported, besides security related issues outside of Drupal.
  This also means that at that point the 'legacy' version will no longer
  receive Drupal core upgrades, even if there will be security core releases.

  Note that we don't use the term "major release" in the known convention
  for versions naming. It is because the first digit, for historical reasons,
  refers to the Aegir version supported, the second digit refers to BOA stack
  major release, and the last digit refers to both feature and bugfix BOA
  stack upgrades.

#-### Important Note For Those Using Our Hosted Aegir Service!

  NOW is the time (and last chance) to upgrade all your legacy Drupal 5 sites
  and outdated Drupal 6 sites still not compatible with at least PHP 5.3,
  because once we upgrade to the *next* major BOA Edition, it will be no longer
  possible to still run Drupal sites not compatible with PHP 5.3 -- there
  were literally years of this legacy support provided, and this finally
  comes to the end, because we will not use the BOA 'legacy' mode on our own
  servers. It will be still available for remotely managed 'Aegir on Your Own
  Server' option, though, but only on request: https://omega8.cc/support

#-### Custom php.ini protection has changed and will not honor old settings

  If you have custom settings in any of your php.ini files protected with
  old variable in the /root/.barracuda.cnf, make a backup of your ini files
  before running this upgrade. While these files will not get overwritten,
  they will no longer be used, because we have introduced new, standardized
  directory structure to properly support multi-PHP-versions systems.

  Respective php.ini files are now located in /opt/phpXX/etc/phpXX.ini
  for FPM and /opt/phpXX/lib/php.ini for CLI, where XX is 55, 54, 53 or 52,
  depending on the versions listed via _PHP_MULTI_INSTALL variable in the
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file. Also the variables used to protect ini files
  from being overwritten have changed to _CUSTOM_CONFIG_PHPXX.

  If you need any non-standard settings in any of active ini files, don't
  overwrite them with the old files, but rather carefully review and apply
  only the differences you need.

#-### Barracuda no longer supports Percona since 2.2.0 release

  If you have used Percona before, Barracuda will force upgrade to MariaDB 5.5
  and PHP rebuild automatically. We plan to add possibility to install
  MariaDB 10.0 once released as stable and tested. MariaDB is the default
  DB server in Barracuda for a long time already.

#-### Support for PHP FPM/CLI version safe switch per Octopus instance

  This allows to easily switch PHP version by the instance owner w/o system
  admin (root) help. All you need to do is to create ~/static/control/fpm.info
  and ~/static/control/cli.info file with a single line telling the system
  which available PHP version should be used (if installed): 5.5 or 5.4 or 5.3

  Only one of them can be set, but you can use separate versions for web access
  (fpm.info) and the Aegir backend (cli.info). The system will switch versions
  defined via these control files in 5 minutes or less. We use external control
  files and not any option in the Aegir interface to make sure you will never
  lock yourself by switching to version which may cause unexpected problems.

  Note that the same version will be used in all platforms and all sites hosted
  on the same Octopus instance. Why not to try latest and greatest PHP 5.5 now?

#-### All PHP FPM workers in 5.5, 5.4 and 5.3 now use the 'ondemand' mode

  This change will help to better manage memory use, especially on systems with
  multiple PHP versions running in parallel. This will also free resources
  and allocate them dynamically only when requests are coming and only to
  the active FPM pools. Note that the 'ondemand' mode doesn't affect Zend
  OPcache, because it is managed by the parent process(es) which stay(s) active.

  The net result is that on a vanilla BOA install, without non-hostmaster sites
  running, the complete stack consumes just ~200 MB of RAM (in total, so with
  MariaDB, Redis and Nginx etc. included) with all three PHP-FPM versions
  running in parallel: 5.5, 5.4 and 5.3:

  CPU[#*                                                       2.0%]

  Swp[                                                        0/0MB]

  magic:~# ps axf | grep fpm

   8402 ? Ss 0:00 php-fpm: master process (/opt/php53/etc/php53-fpm.conf)
  magic:~#

#-### Drush aliases are now automatically copied to all relevant accounts

  While Aegir manages Drush aliases for its backend needs, they are normally
  not available for the main nor the extra shell users on the instance.

  But starting with 2.2.0, BOA automatically manages copies of all Drush
  aliases, by adding them, updating or removing, every 5 minutes, once it
  detects that there are changes applied, like: the site has been migrated
  to another platform, or associated client/owner has been updated, etc.

  You no longer need to `cd` to the respective site directory to perform
  some available Drush tasks. Just check the available aliases list with
  `drush aliases` and then enjoy the beauty of `drush @foo.com command` syntax.

#-### Drush is now restricted to use only trusted modules installed by default

  Note: this change affects only Aegir backend/system user, typically o1,
  while all other limited shell accounts are not affected, because they are
  already individually jailed with protected custom php.ini and special
  Drush wrappers and settings.

  This means that you can skip this section if you are on a hosted Aegir.

  Customized Drush now included in BOA by default, will be able to use only
  extensions/commands bundled with contrib modules which are either a part
  of modules added in every platform via shared o_contrib/o_contrib_seven
  symlink located in the platform core modules directory, or are included
  in the built-in platforms installation profiles space, or in the system
  account, protected .drush sub-directory.

  This means that any Drush extension/command bundled with contrib module
  uploaded to the sites/all/modules space in all built-in platforms will be
  ignored and not available on command line for the backend user. The same
  applies to site level contrib space, if used.

  Additionally, any Drush extension/command bundled with custom platforms
  located in the ~/static directory tree will be completely ignored by Drush,
  no matter where uploaded: core, profiles, sites/all or sites/foo.com space.

  This is not a problem in hosted environments, where users normally never
  should have an access to the Aegir backend user, anyway.

  If you have any reason to use Drush on command line as an Aegir backend/system
  user, for example to escape limited shell restrictions, we recommend to
  install vanilla Drush 6, for example in /opt/tools/drush/vanilla/drush/ and
  then symlink it into /usr/local/bin/ with custom name, so it will be available
  automatically in your backend o1 user's PATH.

  Further improvements to secure sites and instances in a completely locked
  virtual jails are planned in next BOA releases, which will address all other
  known and even potential security issues in Aegir.

#-### The ~/.drush and other important directories and symlinks are protected

  There are directories, files and symlinks which should be protected from
  any changes and managed exclusively by the BOA system. The reasons may vary
  from security to avoidable support requests when the less experienced user
  will delete his sites or platforms symlinks, while they can't be easily nor
  automatically recreated. It also prevents the sub-accounts users from using
  their account home directory as a private upload/archive disk space.

#-### Support for safely configurable cache bins exceptions in Redis

  Sometimes you may want to exclude some problematic cache bins from Redis
  so they will use default SQL engine, at least until related issue will be
  fixed either in your contrib code or in the Redis integration module.

  Normally you had to edit the local.settings.php file which is both tedious
  and dangerous because of extra steps: https://omega8.cc/node/230 to add
  a line, for example: $conf['cache_class_cache_foo'] = 'DrupalDatabaseCache';
  Plus, it had to be done for every site separately.

  Now you can simply list the cache bins to exclude, comma separated, either
  in the site or platform level active INI file.

  Example: redis_exclude_bins = "cache_views,cache_foo,cache_bar"

#-### Two-Factor-like Authentication to protect access to Chive DB Manager

  We are introducing Two-Factor-like Authentication logic - now extended also
  to protect Chive DB Manager, Collectd Graph Panel and SQL Buddy DB Manager.
  You must be logged in via SSH and run any auto-continuos command, for example:
  `ping -i 30 google.com` to keep the access open for your IP address.

  Why is this important?

  While BOA forces HTTPS connection for Chive, anyone who knows the URL can
  access it and attempt to either run brute-force attack to get into your
  site's database, or at least attempt to hammer the server and cause DoS-like
  effects, at least until the system will block his IP on the firewall.

  The other important reason is that your site's DB credentials change only
  when you migrate or rename the site, and otherwise remain intact. Now, what
  if you have an employee or a freelancer whom you no longer want to be able
  to access your site? If you think that deleting his SFTP sub-account is
  enough, think again. He still can access your site's database via Chive, if
  he knows the site's DB credentials and the Chive URL.

  But now it's no longer possible. Only the visitor who is able to successfully
  authenticate himself via SSH, and keeps active SSH session, will be able
  to access the Chive URL. The rest of the world will see just dummy Nginx 403
  Access Denied error.

  And in case you are using self-hosted BOA, the same protection is applied
  also to Collectd Graph Panel and SQL Buddy DB Manager.

#-### Support for session.cookie_lifetime configurable via INI files

  You can control session cookies expiration (TTL) per site and per platform.
  The value (in seconds) of the session_cookie_ttl variable is used as
  session.cookie_lifetime value.

  BOA default defined in the system level global.inc file is 86400 == 24h.

  We also recommend that you enable and configure built-in session_expire
  module, which allows you to keep the sessions DB table tidy. Make sure that
  TTL set via session_cookie_ttl variable is *lower* than TTL configured
  in the session_expire module, because the module does not care about PHP
  settings and simply deletes old entries from the sessions table on cron run.

#-### Support for files permissions-fix exceptions via platform level INI file

  You can opt-out from globally enabled daily-permissions-fix procedure per
  platform with new fix_files_permissions_daily variable.

  This feature can be useful when you prefer to manage custom platform in
  a monolithic codebase mode in Git, so forcing permissions could conflict
  with your workflow or development tools. Otherwise you should never disable
  this to avoid issues with Aegir tasks related to sites on this platform.

  Note that the system level option _PERMISSIONS_FIX (introduced in BOA-2.1.0
  and set to NO by default) should be also enabled with YES in the system level
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file, if you prefer to have permissions fixed in all
  sites on all platforms, except those with fix_files_permissions_daily = FALSE
  set in the platform level, active INI file.

#-### High-performance JavaScript callback handler (js) in all platforms

  All platforms, both built-in and custom in the ~/static directory tree, enjoy
  automatically added High-performance JavaScript callback handler (js) support,
  which requires extra /js.php file in the platform root and also proper Nginx
  rewrites. The module itself is also included in the built-in o_contrib bundle.

  All you need is to enable the module, if recommended by any other module,
  and enjoy much faster page generation, where possible. You can review the
  full list of modules which will benefit from this great helper module on its
  project page: https://drupal.org/project/js


  Enjoy another super-fast and even more powerful BOA Edition!

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to BOA-2.2.0 release (all fixed)

  ==> Updated on Tue Apr  1 12:20:27 SGT 2014

  @=> Issues hot-fixed in stable (run 'barracuda up-stable system' to apply):

  * Compass Tools don't use correct paths to Ruby 2.1.1
  * Chive Authentication via SSH session doesn't work on some older instances.
  * PHP: Disabled 'create_function' may break some contrib modules or code.
  * PHP: Disabled 'assert' may cause warnings on features revert.
  * Cron for sites doesn't work on old instances without Nginx wildcard vhost.
  * The 'git pull' command is broken in limited shell.
  * FTPS (FTP over SSL) connections may experience TLS problems.
  * The 'rsync' command is broken in limited shell.
  * The drush dl foo can't be run outside of site directory.


### Stable BOA-2.1.3 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Thu Nov 21 17:55:47 SGT 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  This release provides Drupal 7.24.1 and Pressflow 6.29.1 core security upgrade
  for all supported distributions. It also includes two updated platforms and
  several fixes for issues discovered since BOA-2.1.2 released 3 days ago, plus
  some clever improvements to help you automatically optimize all tables daily,
  or even automatically convert tables to-innodb or to-myisam, either per site
  or per platform, or per entire Octopus instance. There is also Purge Cruft
  Machine available to run some spring-cleaning daily with configurable TTL.

  Enjoy another super-fast and even more clever BOA Edition!

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  ### Drupal 7.24.1

  Open Atrium 2.0.9 ------------ http://drupal.org/project/openatrium
  OpenScholar 3.9.3 ------------ http://openscholar.harvard.edu

# New features and enhancements in this release:

  * Purge Cruft Machine moved to daily.sh agent and made configurable
    with _DEL_OLD_BACKUPS and _DEL_OLD_TMP per Octopus instance.

    If changed to any number greater than "0" it will automatically delete
    backups stored in the /data/disk/U/backups/ directory and in all hosted
    sites backup_migrate directories, during daily cleanup, if created more
    than X days ago, where X is a number of days defined in _DEL_OLD_BACKUPS.

    If "0" then this feature is disabled. It can't be configured via INI files,
    so you may need to submit support request if you want to customize this
    option set to 7 days by default on all hosted instances, as per our
    backups policy: https://omega8.cc/backups

    The same logic applies to _DEL_OLD_TMP which defines for how long the
    temporary files in all hosted sites files/tmp/ and private/temp/ directories
    are kept before deleting them during running daily maintenance.

  * Added sql_conversion_mode variable in the platform and site level INI
    to customize instance-wide mode optionally set via _SQL_CONVERT.

    This option allows to activate and/or customize DB tables conversion
    per site, per platform and via _SQL_CONVERT per Octopus instance.

    Supported values are: innodb and myisam (lowercase only!)
    Note that this conversion will run daily even if all tables have been
    already converted, so it will run OPTIMIZE on all tables, effectively.

    Related Issue #2126471 - Convert DB engine control files to ini format.

# Changes in this release:

  * Allow to install unsupported distros only in head, not stable.
  * Contrib update: advagg-7.x-2.3
  * Map drush to drush6 on command line. You can still use drush4 and drush5.
  * New contrib: display_cache
  * New contrib: panels_content_cache
  * Nginx 1.5.7 -- security upgrade.
  * Use dev versions of CDN module with patch for AdvAgg 7 compatibility.
  * Use Drush 5 and 6 head until next release.

# Fixes in this release:

  * Always cleanup temp downloads to avoid failed builds due to leftovers.
  * Always fix permissions on contrib on upgrade and in daily.sh agent.
  * Better auto-recovery when broken libcurl is detected.
  * Delete any tar/gz/zip files in modules|themes|libraries daily.
  * Delete dangerous local-allow.info file.
  * Display all active INI variables in HTTP headers on dev URLs.
  * Fix for cron auto-correction.
  * Fix for Feature Server broken due to incorrect context version downloaded.
  * Fix the logic for cURL install from sources.
  * Nginx: Add Access-Control-Allow-Origin header also for static .json
  * Nginx: Protect also .md files in modules|themes|libraries dirs.
  * Issue #2137583 - Permissions on the site directory are broken after running,
    how ironically, the Health Check task.
  * Issue #2138811 - Maintenance agent disables modules from its standard
    turn-off list, even if they are required by other modules, apps or features.

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to initial BOA-2.1.3 release

  ==> Updated on Thu Nov 28 18:33:58 SGT 2013.

  @=> Issues which will trigger `barracuda up-stable system` if discovered:

  * PHP: Fix for broken cURL from sources install logic.
  * PHP: Fix for forced rebuild mode if lib curl is broken or updated.
  * PHP: Fix for legacy 5.2 rebuild required when broken libcurl is detected.
  * Use dummy variable instead of 'true' to avoid breaking the logic.

  @=> Issues which will NOT trigger `barracuda up-stable system` if discovered:

  * Add coder to the auto-disabled modules list -- see #2068771
  * Excessive and useless Drush internal cache clear in daily.sh
  * Issue #2141283 - Drush aliases like `drush dbup` no longer work properly.
  * Issue #8215957 - Invalid version type error in old Drush Make.
  * MariaDB 5.5.34 just released.
  * Redis: Incorrect permissions on the integration module directory.
  * Modules can be incorrectly whitelisted by installation profile and
    never disabled, while they should be.

# HotFix for known post-upgrade issues

  Run the boa-fix-upgrade script when logged in as system root:

  $ cd;rm -f boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt*
  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt
  $ bash boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt

  This script is updated once there is any new regression or bug discovered,
  so it is safe and recommended to run it again if the list of known issues
  have been updated. Note that this script will detect and fix all Octopus
  instances on your system at once.


### Stable BOA-2.1.2 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Mon Nov 18 00:03:30 SGT 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  This is primarily a bug-fix release and you should read release notes and
  also the changelog for both BOA-2.1.1 and BOA-2.1.0 for a context, especially
  if you are upgrading from BOA-2.0.9 or older release (we have tested upgrades
  from as old Editions as BOA-2.0.1, released on Dec 28 07:00:00 EST 2011).

  This Edition includes fixes for all Known Issues on systems already upgraded
  to initial BOA-2.1.1 release, plus some extra improvements and one updated
  platform (Managing News).

  Important new features include ability to use either legacy (default) or
  modern (highly recommended) version of Redis integration module.

  The reason we don't enable the modern version by default is that it may need
  some testing before using it on a complex Drupal sites. The modern version
  of Redis integration module comes with some great new features which allow
  you to configure flush mode per cache bin, with three modes available.

  Please refer to the module README for more information on all available
  advanced flush modes: http://bit.ly/1drmi35

  It also comes with super-fast lock backend, which can be enabled only when
  you are using the modern version, but still needs more improvements, so we
  auto-configure some exceptions on the fly, when it is used, to avoid known
  issues, as reported in the queue: https://drupal.org/node/2135545

  Please read also INI docs to understand how it works, and how to improve
  performance by enabling and tuning these settings: http://bit.ly/1bwfZZj

  Enjoy!

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to initial BOA-2.1.2 release

  ==> Updated on Thu Nov 21 01:28:23 SGT 2013 with all fixes applied to stable.

  * Feature Server platform is broken since BOA-2.1.0 due to incorrect context
    module version downloaded via makefile. This bug affects only some instances
    upgraded to head and not stable, but since in the first 24 hours after
    BOA-2.1.2 release our static downloads were still out of sync on two of
    our mirrors, it is safe to assume that you should run the HotFix via
    boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt anyway.

  * There is regression introduced in the maintenance agent logic, which
    results with dependency check effectively ignored. This may cause various
    disastrous effects, like disabling all modules chained via feature or
    via apps module, because apps module requires update module, which is
    normally disabled. While any feature which requires dblog or update module
    enabled is considered as a serious developer error and should be avoided,
    we have to respect all dependencies defined to never break any site by
    forcefully disabling modules.

  * Part of the Site Health Check task (the `drush6 status-report` command)
    breaks permissions on the site directory, which blocks any further tasks
    like Clone, Migrate and Backup. This regression was introduced in the
    BOA-2.1.0 release.

# HotFix for known post-upgrade issues

  Run the boa-fix-upgrade script when logged in as system root:

  $ cd;rm -f boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt*
  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt
  $ bash boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt

  This script is updated once there is any new regression or bug discovered,
  so it is safe and recommended to run it again if the list of known issues
  have been updated. Note that this script will detect and fix all Octopus
  instances on your system at once.


### Stable BOA-2.1.1 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Sat Nov  9 17:00:00 EST 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  There are some important bug fixes in this release, along with changes
  to the Auto-(En|Dis)able agent, explained in greater detail in embedded docs
  included in platform specific INI file template.

  Note that the system agent doesn't modify any existing and active INI file,
  so updated docs are included only in the updated each morning INI templates:
  default.boa_platform_control.ini and default.boa_site_control.ini

  You can find both INI templates also online at: https://omega8.cc/node/293

  We have also added some docs to help you if you experience any issues
  with cached, Views based pages and panels: https://omega8.cc/node/292

  Note also that since BOA-2.1.0 all D6 based sites are forced to use PHP 5.3.27
  on hosted and managed Aegir instances, even if they were previously configured
  to use deprecated, insecure, unstable and outdated PHP 5.2 for D6 based sites.

  This means that if you are using either too old D6 core (older than 6.28.x)
  some features will stop working, namely imagecache, /update.php and any
  feature which depends on contrib modules not yet compatible with PHP 5.3

  We have allowed to use PHP 5.2 for too long, to give enough time (in years)
  to upgrade to latest Pressflow 6.x version and we no longer can extend
  this allowance, for obvious security and systems stability reasons.

  Furthermore, sticking with PHP 5.2 would not allow us to use latest Aegir 2.x
  version (BOA still includes a bit older Aegir 2.x for backward compatibility),
  since newer Aegir versions need newer Drush (BOA still uses ancient Drush 4.6)
  and newer Drush requires newer PHP version.

  It is even more important because Drupal 8 will not run on older PHP nor Drush
  older than 7.x, so there is basically no choice other than make all your sites
  compatible with PHP 5.3, or you will miss all future BOA system upgrades.

  Now even PHP 5.3 is officially in the EOL (End-of-Live) phase, with only
  security fixes expected, but also only until July 2014 and then it will be
  completely deprecated, so we will have to switch to modern PHP 5.5, first
  introduced as an option, later this year.

  Upgrading to latest Pressflow 6.x is *very* easy. Just add all contrib modules
  you are using in your outdated 6.x platform to the latest Pressflow 6.x
  platform we provide by default, reverify the new platform, clone the site
  in the old platform, migrate the cloned copy to the new platform and if
  everything works fine, migrate also your live site. It will take less than
  15 minutes and there is absolutely no excuse to not upgrade.

  If you experience issues with your site due to the old core used on now forced
  PHP 5.3, we can temporarily revert it to PHP 5.2 for the last time, but it is
  really a bad idea. Much better idea is to find those 15 minutes and upgrade
  your site, so we could continue to provide future upgrades and new amazing
  features also for your Aegir instance.

  Enjoy new, shiny BOA Edition!

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to initial BOA-2.1.1 release

  ==> Updated on Tue Nov 12 14:44:16 EST 2013 with all fixes applied to stable.

  * Fast Redis lock may cause problems on node edit, with temporary error
    saying that the node was changed by "another user", because current
    implementation was not multisite-aware enough.

  * Views Cache Bully module, if enabled after upgrade to BOA-2.1.0, may break
    the cart and checkout on sites using Ubercart, and should be disabled
    automatically like it is done for Commerce based sites since BOA-2.1.1

  * The version of Redis integration module included: 7.x-2.3 causes warnings
    for D6 sites, visible either on dev URLs or on command line and may break
    some advanced Views configurations if custom caching is not yet enabled.
    It may also break menu updates due to not aggressive enough cache clear
    policy for cache_menu bin.

  * Permissions set daily on the civicrm.settings.php file are too restrictive
    and since provision_civicrm extension does not make this file writable
    before attempting to re-create it, as it should, all tasks on CiviCRM
    enabled sites fail.

  * Permissions on sites/all/{modules,theme,libraries} on newly added, empty
    platforms with no sites created yet, so not included in the running daily
    permissions fix, are initially not group writable, as they should be.

  * The check_if_required procedure in the running daily maintenance agent to
    detect if the module is required by any other module or feature or by
    installation profile, is 6 (six) slower than it should be and never disables
    devel module properly.

  * The running daily maintenance agent does not disable files checks for
    Drupal for Facebook (fb) and Domain Access modules as it should in the
    platform level INI file, unless those modules are detected.

# HotFix for known post-upgrade issues

  Run the boa-fix-upgrade script when logged in as system root:

  $ cd;rm -f boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt*
  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt
  $ bash boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt

  This script is updated once there is any new regression or bug discovered,
  so it is safe and recommended to run it again if the list of known issues
  have been updated.

  You can also run another upgrade with "barracuda up-stable system" command,
  followed by "octopus up-stable all both log" since all fixes have been applied
  to current stable as well, but boa-fix-upgrade script is faster than running
  complete upgrade again.


### Stable BOA-2.1.0 Release - Full Edition - Now NSA-proof
### Date: Sat Nov  2 18:15:19 EDT 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  There are some really important changes and improvements in this release
  you should be aware of before running your BOA system upgrade.

  Even if you are on a hosted BOA system with upgrades managed for you,
  it is very important to read at least this release notes.

  And if you are more curious, read also the giant changelog further below.

  Besides all changes, fixes and improvements, all currently supported
  Drupal distributions have been upgraded to use latest Drupal core versions.

  Plus, there are seven (7) NEW platforms included!

#-### Control files to customize your BOA system per platform and per site

  Almost all control files are now replaced with two centralized,
  platform and site specific INI files, using standard PHP INI format.

  The platform specific INI file template with extensive documentation
  included, has filename default.boa_platform_control.ini and is located
  in the sites/all/modules directory.

  The site specific INI file template with extensive documentation
  included, has filename default.boa_site_control.ini and is located
  in the sites/foo.com/modules directory.

  Any existing control files, both on the platform and site level
  will be automatically converted into active INI files and then deleted
  to avoid confusion, also automatically, on the first run of the special
  maintenance script: /var/xdrago/daily.sh but defaults in the global.inc
  file will allow for smooth, fully automated transition.

  This change will improve customizing your BOA system maintainability
  and overall system performance/load thanks to minimized files checks.

#-### Empty and not used platforms auto-cleanup

  BOA has finally the ability to auto-delete, during daily maintenance,
  which happens each morning (server time zone), all empty and not used
  platforms. While on all hosted instances the TTL (time-to-live) is set
  to 60 days (counted since last verify task date/time on the platform),
  it can be configured per instance in the /root/.USER.octopus.cnf file
  by changing value of _DEL_OLD_EMPTY_PLATFORMS variable to anything
  higher than 0 (days), which is default (and means the feature is OFF).

  Note that every Octopus instance upgrade re-verifies all existing platforms,
  so if you will configure the TTL to 90 days but you will run the upgrade
  every month or every two months, no platforms will ever be deleted.

  If you wish to have this TTL customized on the hosted instance, where
  it is set to 60 (days) by default, please open a support ticket via:
  https://omega8.cc/support

  Remotely managed BOA systems can have this feature enabled and configured
  upon request submitted via https://omega8.cc/support

#-### All-in-One Site Health Check in your Aegir control panel

  You will notice a new Task available on every site page in your Aegir
  Control Panel, named "Run health check". This new task will run a few
  important tests on your site and will store all results in the Task Log,
  so you easily review all results by clicking on the "View" button to the
  right of the task, when it is complete. Make sure to check all details
  by clicking on the "Expand" links in the log.

  What are the tests included?

  1. The "drush clean-modules" command will be run for you to make sure
     there is no module left in the system table as "enabled" while it
     no longer even exists on the system. This part will utilize (behind
     the scenes) extension: https://drupal.org/project/clean_missing_modules
     If it will find any such leftover, it will clean it up, automatically.

  2. The "drush6 pm-updatestatus" command is a native Drush command which
     tells you if there are any waiting module/code updates in the site.
     Note: it will *not* upgrade anything, it is a check only.
     Of course there should be no updates waiting if you follow Aegir
     site upgrade best practices and your site's code is up to date.
     Yes, this check will automatically enable the "update" module for you,
     but it will not auto-disable it afterwards (to not break things in case
     it is required by some other module or feature).

  3. The "drush6 status-report" command is a native Drush command
     which provides you a complete overview of your site status.
     Instead of logging into the site, you can review it easily here.

  4. The "drush6 updatedb-status" command is a native Drush command
     which tells you if there are any waiting database updates in the site.
     Note: it will *not* apply these updates, it is a check only.
     Of course there should be no updates waiting if you follow Aegir
     site upgrade best practices, but who knows, hence the check.

  5. The "drush security-review" command will run only on Drupal 7 based sites
     and provides some additional information by using (behind the scenes)
     this extension: https://drupal.org/project/security_review

#-### PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) support in Nginx

  BOA now fully supports the most secure, yet still compatible with most
  used systems and browsers SSL configuration.

  All hosted BOA instances have been already upgraded automatically and
  you don't need to do anything to make it work -- it is already done
  for you -- both on any SSL enabled site with dedicated certificate
  and IP address and also on the standard, system-wide SSL proxy level,
  which is available for every hosted site -- just type HTTPS:// in the URL.

  On self-hosted instances it needs to be enabled by adding a line in your
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file: _NGINX_FORWARD_SECRECY=YES before the upgrade.
  Note that depending on the system used, it may auto-install some
  requirements like latest OpenSSL libraries and packages.

  Remotely managed BOA systems can have this feature enabled upon request
  submitted via https://omega8.cc/support

#-### SPDY (new networking protocol) support in Nginx

  BOA now fully supports the advanced, new protocol which allows to run
  sites over HTTPS with much better performance than plain HTTP.

  While not all browsers support this protocol yet, it is already enabled
  by default on all hosted BOA instances (but obviously works only when you
  access the site via HTTPS:// in the URL).

  On self-hosted instances it needs to be enabled by adding a line in your
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file: _NGINX_SPDY=YES before the upgrade.
  Note that depending on the system used, it may auto-install some
  requirements like latest OpenSSL libraries and packages.

  Remotely managed BOA systems can have this feature enabled upon request
  submitted via https://omega8.cc/support

#-### Zend OPcache replaced APC in PHP

  Newer versions of PHP already come with next generation opcode cache
  from Zend, which is now open-sourced and available also as an extension
  for older PHP versions, including 5.2 and 5.3

  BOA leverages this opportunity and now uses Zend OPcache instead of APC.

  This change is introduced automatically on all systems, both hosted
  and managed for you and also self-hosted.

  Only Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Precise systems which are using PHP
  installed from packages and not from sources, so with _BUILD_FROM_SRC=NO
  set in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file, still use APC by default.
  You can install Zend OPcache by changing it to _BUILD_FROM_SRC=YES
  before running the upgrade.

  Note that Zend OPcache default configuration caches every script for
  60 seconds, so any changes you will introduce, will be visible with
  up to 1 minute delay. However, if there is .dev. or .devel. in the site
  name, this delay is lowered automatically to just 1 second.

  You can change the default per site permanently by adding in the
  local.settings.php preferred value, for example, to set it to 10 seconds:
  ini_set('opcache.revalidate_freq', '10'); -- but remember that you will
  override default (1 second) for dev URLs using this method.

  Enjoy the most advanced, NSA-proof BOA Edition yet!

### Stable BOA-2.0.9 Release - Barracuda Edition
### Date: Thu May  9 11:25:59 EDT 2013
### Includes Aegir from BOA-2.0.8 Edition

# This is the first Barracuda-only Edition, released to address important
  security issue with Nginx server and provide system level upgrades.

  This Edition will not upgrade Aegir Master nor Aegir Satellite Instances,
  because there was no new Drupal core released since BOA-2.0.8 Edition and
  there were not enough updates to built-in platforms or contrib accumulated.

  Releasing Barracuda-only Edition separately from full Edition allows us
  to address system/services security issues without any extra delay,
  while releasing Octopus-only Edition will allow us to provide Drupal core
  or Aegir version upgrades, without affecting system level services.

  There is also another reason why separate releases will be useful.
  BOA-2.0.9 is the last Edition where Aegir 2.x still uses old Drush 4.6
  in the backend. We need to sync BOA specific Aegir 2.x with upstream
  and finally switch to Drush 5, or even Drush 6, if possible.

  This change, however, may cause issues if you still host legacy Drupal 5
  or some old Drupal 6 sites, with either core or contrib not compatible
  with PHP 5.3, which is now used by default.

  That is why we plan to introduce ability to install older/previous
  Barracuda and/or Octopus release, if you need more time to upgrade.

# New features and enhancements in this release:

  * Debian 7.0 Wheezy support.
  * Automated upgrade from Squeeze with _SQUEEZE_TO_WHEEZY=YES option.

  * Nginx: Check for Linux/Cdorked.A malware and delete if discovered.
  * Re-generate and sync Aegir passwords before and after instance upgrade.
  * The silent 'system' mode documented in docs/UPGRADE.txt
  * Allow to exclude platform from otherwise forced `drush en entitycache -y`
    if sites/all/modules/entitycache_dont_enable.info control file is present.

# Changes in this release:

  * Nginx 1.5.0 - security upgrade for CVE-2013-2028

* We plan to shorten BOA system release and upgrades cycle
  to 1-2 months max, so we have decided to remove support for some
  outdated distros. We have tried to manage both security and version
  updates for some abandoned or semi-abandoned distros, to keep them
  useful for you, but since it involves increasing amount of work
  because of cascades of no longer compatible patches and various
  dependencies, we have decided that it is time to stop doing it,
  if their original maintainers no longer care about their users.

### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.3
### Date: Thu May 17 18:17:40 EST 2012
### Installs Aegir 2.0.3 compatible with Aegir 1.9

# There are major improvements and new features added in this BOA Edition.

  Here is the description of those most important/expected, while complete
  list of all changes, new features and fixes is available further below.

  * Caching backend has been simplified. We no longer use chained cache
    system with Memcached+Redis+database. New system uses only Redis cache
    and the same configuration for all Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms.
    This new system doesn't require any extra module to be enabled in any site.
    Complete integration is already enabled by default for every platform/site
    installed by default and for every custom platform as before - the next
    day after first site on the custom platform has been created.
    You can disable this caching layer using the same modules/cache/NO.txt
    control file as before. While there is just one cache engine (Redis) used,
    there is also an automatic, instant failover to standard database caching,
    just in case Redis is not available for some reason. You can also disable
    Redis cache on the fly for debugging by adding ?noredis=1 to any URL.

  * We have added support for Drupal 8.x while still using modified
    Drush 4.6-dev version, so we can still support Drupal 5 on the same
    system, but on another Octopus instance.

  * You can choose different PHP version for PHP-FPM (web access)
    and PHP-CLI, for even greater control over compatibility with
    various Drupal major versions.

  * You can choose both PHP-FPM and PHP-CLI versions per Octopus instance,
    on the same system. And you can change those versions on upgrade.

  * Installing and upgrading BOA system has been greatly simplified.
    You can still configure and run both installers as before,
    but you can also use these new, shockingly simple command line tools
    to install Barracuda and Octopus at once, to install more Octopus
    instances, to run selective or batch upgrades of all Octopus instances etc.
    See docs/INSTALL.txt and docs/UPGRADE.txt for details.

  * We have added an 'easy install' configuration shortcuts for both
    standard (public) and localhost installs. You no longer need
    to read, understand and configure all options, unless you prefer
    to choose some non-default configuration options.

  * Default installs on Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Precise use
    packages for PHP 5.3, so initial setup takes just 10-15 minutes.

  * You can easily grant limited shell and FTPS access for developers,
    simply by creating "Clients" in the Aegir control panel and define
    them as 'owners' of one or more sites. Their access will be limited
    to only sites they can manage, but only if you will send them their
    access credentials, which are independent of their Aegir control
    panel credentials and stored in the ~/users/ directory in your main account.
    You will find there files with passwords for every "Client" with at least
    one site attached. For example ~/users/o1.username file means that
    this Client's username for SSH and FTPS access is 'o1.username' while
    his password is stored in this file. This means that SSH/FTPS access
    is not granted automatically, but you can decide who should receive it.
    How to change any extra user's password? Simply delete his ~/users/o1.username
    file and wait up to 5 minutes - the system will re-create his account
    with new password. And how to delete the user completely? Simply
    delete this user "Client" account in the Aegir control panel and allow
    the system to delete also his SSH/FTPS access in the next 5 minutes.

  * We have added segfault monitor for php-fpm and nginx, enabled by default.
    It is pretty aggressive, because it disables vhost of any site causing
    segfault errors and sends email alert to the Octopus instance owner
    and server owner email addresses. Simple site re-verify in Aegir enables
    the site again - but until the next segfault only, so read the info
    included in the email alert message, if this will happen. If you prefer
    to not run this monitor: `rm -f /var/xdrago/monitor/check/segfault_alert`

  * Previously recommended site and platforms re-verify on Clone or Migrate
    is now fully automated. Aegir will run these extra tasks as a part
    of Clone or Migrate task, to make sure that there are no errors
    and that Aegir is using up-to-date information collected about
    platforms and sites. It also automatically fixes the known problem
    with domain aliases incorrectly written in the original and cloned sites,
    as reported in the Aegir queue: http://drupal.org/node/1004526

  * Apps are now fully supported. If the App is not downloaded yet, installing
    it via browser only requires write permissions, normally never available
    for the web server user, so you need to create an empty control file, either
    in sites/all/modules/apps-allow.info or sites/domain/modules/apps-allow.info
    and then run 'Reset password' task. It will open write access where required
    until the next site 'Verify' task will run . After installing the App,
    remember to re-Verify the site to restore default, safe permissions.

  * Custom local.settings.php file support uses similar logic with control file
    sites/domain/modules/local-allow.info and also 'Reset password' task.
    After running this task the local.settings.php file will be group writable,
    so you will be able to edit it also when logged in as limited shell user.
    Remember to run site Verify when done, to restore standard, safe permissions.
    Note that this file is created automatically, but is not open for write
    access by default.

### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.2
### Date: Thu Feb 9 14:00:00 EST 2012
### Installs Aegir 2.0.2

# Note on new and updated platforms and new Drupal core:

  All 6.x and 7.x platforms have been updated with latest core,
  so they are all in fact new in this BOA Edition, but we list here
  only really new platforms or those with new version released
  since last BOA Edition, with one exception: we list also basic
  6.24.1 and 7.12 platforms as new.

  Please note that instead of waiting for 6.25, we already
  included patches required to fix major issues with 6.24:

  http://drupal.org/node/1425868
  http://drupal.org/node/1425260

  Our Pressflow 6.24.1 +Extra version includes not only listed
  above patches, but also a few extra, performance related
  patches discussed here:

  http://groups.drupal.org/node/187209

  Note also that we renamed too basic Acquia 7.x platform to
  Ubercart 3.x platform. It is based on the same acquia install
  profile, but includes all contrib modules required for any
  basic Ubercart 3.x site.

  NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
  please read our important how-to:

  http://omega8.cc/the-best-recipes-for-disaster-139
  http://omega8.cc/are-there-any-specific-good-habits-to-learn-116
  http://omega8.cc/managing-your-code-in-the-aegir-style-110

  REALLY, PLEASE READ IT TO AVOID SOME HEAVY HEADACHES!

# New Octopus platforms:

  Pressflow 6.24.1 ------------- http://pressflow.org
  Ubercart 3.0.1 --------------- http://ubercart.org

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  Open Outreach 1.0-beta7a ----- http://openoutreach.org
  ProsePoint 0.43 -------------- http://prosepoint.org
  Videola 1.0-alpha2 ----------- http://videola.tv

# New features:

  * Barracuda now supports Debian Lenny to Squeeze major upgrade.
    Of course you should create full backup image before running
    this major system upgrade, just in case, but all the rest
    is fully automated - it is enough to set advanced configuration
    option in Barracuda to _LENNY_TO_SQUEEZE=YES and run Barracuda
    as usual. It will upgrade your system to Squeeze and re-build
    everything, with almost no downtime during the upgrade.
    You will still need to reboot the server when it will complete
    all upgrades.

    Important: Debian Lenny reached EOL on February 6, 2012.
    Details: http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/2012/msg00001.html

  * All new 7.x sites now run on latest PHP-FPM 5.3.10 by default.
    For existing sites it is enough to re-verify them in your
    Aegir control panel to get them on PHP-FPM 5.3.10 automatically.

    All existing and new 5.x sites run on the old PHP-FPM 5.2.17
    version by default and you can't change that.

    You can still choose between PHP-FPM 5.2.17 and 5.3.10 for
    all your 6.x sites - just let us know via http://omega8.cc/support
    that you wish to switch to 5.3.10 - but make sure first that all
    your 6.x sites are fully PHP 5.3 compatible. By default all
    6.x sites still run on PHP-FPM 5.2.17.

    Of course you could choose 5.3.10 for 6.x sites on one Octopus
    instance and 5.2.17 on another - on the same server. Just one more
    reason to use Octopus built-in intelligence :)

    All of this works the same both for Aegir Master Instance
    and all Aegir Satellite Instances.

  * Both Speed Booster, Boost and Redis/Memcached supports separate
    caches per mobile device, so it is safe to use separate themes
    or content for mobile devices. We use simple logic to determine
    the kind of device and there are separate cache bins for
    mobile-tablet, mobile-smart and mobile-other.
    You can review it here: http://bit.ly/wYz6PG

  * Purge module is now enabled by default in all 6.x and also 7.x
    sites. Now Speed Booster works like a Boost - it expires
    immediately the cache for any node/page as soon as it has been
    edited or comment added. It also automatically expires the cache
    for the homepage and RSS feed at once. You no longer need to wait
    up to one hour for Speed Booster cache expiration. Plus, unlike
    in Boost, it purges all separate caches for all mobile devices
    along with non-mobile cache, at once. Now you have a good reason
    to disable Boost and use our crazy fast Speed Booster only.

  * You can use GeoIP data provided by your Nginx server
    in your custom code or modules with variables:
    $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE'] and $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_NAME']
    to display content or block depending on the visitor's country.
    You can check/review it from your location also on command line
    with: 'curl -I http://your-domain' - you will see GeoIP headers.

  * You can safely manage Clients/Users attached to hosted sites
    in your Aegir interface. Make sure that all sites have its
    associated Client! Otherwise the site will be listed as available
    for all Clients/Users you have added. The site can lost its
    association with Client after Clone task if there is any
    non-alphanumeric value in the Client name, like &.

  * CloudFlare specific header 'CF-Connecting-IP' is now supported
    out of the box and available as standard $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
    in all 5.x, 6.x and 7.x platforms without any contrib module.

  * You can disable both Boost and Speed Booster on the fly
    by adding ?nocache=1 to any URL. Useful for debugging.

  * Speed Booster offers now also ESI microcaching, as explained
    in this article: http://groups.drupal.org/node/197478.
    This may enhance not only anonymous visitors, but also
    logged in users experience, since it allows you to separate
    microcache for ESI/SSI includes (valid for just 15 seconds)
    from both default Speed Booster cache for anonymous visitors
    (valid by default for 3 hours, unless purged on demand via
    recently introduced Purge/Expire modules) and also from
    Speed Booster cache per logged in user (valid for 60 seconds).
    The ESI module is included in all 6.x platforms but is not
    enabled and not configured automatically, so please consult
    its documentation for details on how to use it properly.

    Now you have three different levels of Speed Booster cache
    to leverage and deliver the 'live content' experience for
    all visitors, and still protect your server from DoS or
    simply high load caused by unexpected high traffic etc.

  * Automatic configuration of options required when Barracuda
    detects _VMFAMILY=AWS (Amazon EC2).

  * Both _NGINX_WORKERS and _PHP_FPM_WORKERS are now configurable.

  * You can avoid overwriting /etc/mysql/my.cnf with empty
    control file: $ touch /etc/mysql/custom.my.cnf

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/php52/etc/php52.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/php52/lib/php.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/php53/etc/php53.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php53.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root on upgrade
    by adding your extra/custom entries in the extra file:
    $ nano /var/xdrago/cron/custom.txt

  * You can avoid overwriting your CSF configuration on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /var/log/custom.csf.log

### Thu, 2010-09-23 17:30 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade for all pre-A14.A required)

1.  Introducing default SSL Wildcard Nginx Proxy.
    Works for all sites/hostmaster instances on
    the same server and can be used also for
    encrypted connections to Chive and Collectd.
    Doesn't interfere even with SSL enabled sites
    on the same IP (with separate certs).

2.  The redirects are now back and enhanced.
    Fully compatible with Nginx in any combination
    with aliases and SSL settings/modes.

3.  Barracuda and Octopus by default installs still
    Aegir HEAD, but the latest alpha14 also works.

4.  Octopus can define its separate IP address
    if available.

5.  Fixed issue with too aggressive Hot Sauce check,
    causing creating not shared copies of code
    for platforms on every install or upgrade.

6.  Barracuda and Octopus now allows to skip DNS
    test, to make it possible to install on any
    virtualbox with dynamic DNS/IP etc. There is
    no guarantee it will work, but another switch
    is now available, if someone needs it.

7.  Octopus can now turn off local Memcache and Redis
    caches and switch all sites to use defined remote
    caches.

8.  Forced /etc/apt/sources.list rewrite also before
    the Barracuda system upgrade.

9.  Fix for the already installed and possibly broken
    git-core.

10. Fix for Aegir sites with .info domains, the path
    alias should now work without 403 error.


### Fri, 2010-09-17 11:00 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade required)

1. Barracuda and Octopus by default installs now
   Aegir HEAD to use the fix for critical issue
   on sites import. It will be included in alpha14,
   please don't use alpha13.

2. Debian Lenny on 32bit systems works again.
   Fix for broken git-core after upgrade
   to version: 1:1.5.6.5-3+lenny3.1 on Lenny 32bit.

3. Fix and better inline warnings/info about
   missing locales at Linode and RackSpaceCloud.

4. More details in the installer log for better
   debugging and version tracking.

5. E-mail address for alerts on database repair
   started by auto-healing now correctly replaced.

6. Redis for Lenny now built from sources due to
   apt version moved already to Squeeze.

7. Critical bugfix for failed platforms install
   when hostmaster is not upgraded.

8. Introducing simple edition archive:
   http://omega8.cc/dev/bo-a14a.tar.gz

9. Octopus now better supports using newer shared
   code for platforms and introduces new setting:
   _HOT_SAUCE to allow forced fresh/hot code.


### Tue, 2010-09-12 21:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A13.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1.  Octopus now creates SSH/FTPS separate, non-aegir
    account for every Aegir Satellite Instance,
    with limited shell to avoid using commands
    like "drush up" since they should never be used
    on sites managed in the Aegir system.

2.  Octopus now by default sends a welcome email
    with some useful intro information and access
    details to the address defined as _CLIENT_EMAIL.

3.  When Octopus is used the first time to create
    an Aegir Satellite Instance, it doesn't allow
    to skip installing all platforms, since it is
    recommended to add all available platforms with
    initial install, for easier re-using the code
    by next Aegir Satellite Instances.

4.  The second and all future non-core Hostmaster
    installs allow to choose one or more platforms
    or to skip adding platforms at all.

5.  Octopus by default honors initial domain used
    for the Aegir Satellite Instance on every
    upgrade to avoid mistakes with using different
    copies of the script for different Aegir
    Satellite Instances upgrades.

6.  Also Barracuda will always honor initial
    domain used for the core Hostmaster to avoid
    mistakes on upgrade when you don't use
    the original version of the script.

7.  Better checks if the script is running as root.

8.  Removed memcache module since cache is used.

9.  SMTP connection test is now optional.

10. Nginx version set to 0.8.50.

11. By default Aegir 0.4-HEAD instead of alpha13
    is now installed to fix critical issues with
    importing sites.

    See also: http://drupal.org/node/907248

12. Solr and Chive are now optional (Yes/no).

13. Added optional install of Collectd monitor.

14. Fixed issue with SSL mode.

15. Better compatibility for upgrades from
    pre-Barracuda Nginx installs.

16. Now it doesn't start cron before completing all
    install tasks to avoid breaking spinner.

17. Both Barracuda and Octopus now can better
    support re-starting stopped install/upgrade.

18. Octopus now refuses to run if defined domain
    doesn't resolve yet to the server IP address.

19. Octopus now refuses to run on system not
    created initially by Barracuda installer.

20. Custom FQDN hostname is now forced (if defined)
    in Barracuda before running DNS checks.

21. Fix for some missing mime types in vanilla Nginx.

22. Updated versions of Open Atrium, Drupal Commons
    and Cocomore Drupal distros installed by Octopus.

23. Lowered memory defaults in the MariaDB configuration.


### Tue, 2010-08-31 23:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.D

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended because it works!)

1. Upgrade of Aegir Master Instance by Barracuda
   and upgrade of Aegir Satellite Instances by Octopus
   finally works as expected.

2. It is now possible to use Barracuda to install
   environment and Aegir Master Instance, to
   upgrade only environment, to upgrade only Aegir
   Master Instance, or both at the same time.

3. Octopus now can separately install and/or upgrade
   any Aegir Satellite Instance or any platform
   on any instance, separately, using detailed prompt
   with version numbers and links to distributions
   home pages.

4. New platform Cocomore Drupal added in Octopus:
   http://drupal.cocomore.com


### Sat, 2010-08-28 20:15 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.C

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1. By default Aegir 0.4-HEAD with Drush 3.3
   is now installed to fix critical issues with
   importing sites. The fix is also available
   as a patch for alpha12:
   http://drupal.org/node/882970#comment-3382542

2. Both Barracuda and Octopus now allow to choose
   if the Aegir Hostmaster will be upgraded or not.

3. Added versions numbers and links to all platforms
   Yes/no prompts.

4. /tmp directory no longer used to avoid problems
   due to secure noexec mount.

5. Improved readme and docs (in progress).

6. Removed old, no longer supported installer.


### Fri, 2010-08-27 04:15 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade optional)

1. Octopus now allows to install or upgrade only Aegir
   Satellite Instance without any platforms added.

2. Enabled again early exit on the first error to avoid
   confusing cascade of errors if something went wrong.

3. Both Barracuda and Octopus runs now faster.


### Thu, 2010-08-26 19:30 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade from previous versions recommended)

1. Barracuda now includes multicore Apache Solr Search,
   Redis and Memcache.

2. Barracuda now can upgrade packages selectively.
   Just run it again to upgrade the system and the
   Aegir Master Instance.

3. Octopus can create many Aegir Satellite Instances
   on the same server, each with different set of platforms,
   but with ability to share the code between instances,
   so you can use this system even on the low end VPS.

4. Chive database manager added by default with db.
   subdomain (may require dns entry or wildcard).


### Thu, 2010-08-26 08:55 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.A
