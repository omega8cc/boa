### Stable BOA-2.1.3 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Thu Nov 21 17:55:47 SGT 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  This release provides Drupal 7.24.1 and Pressflow 6.29.1 core security upgrade
  for all supported distributions. It also includes two updated platforms and
  several fixes for issues discovered since BOA-2.1.2 released 3 days ago, plus
  some clever improvements to help you automatically optimize all tables daily,
  or even automatically convert tables to-innodb or to-myisam, either per site
  or per platform, or per entire Octopus instance. There is also Purge Cruft
  Machine available to run some spring-cleaning daily with configurable TTL.

  Enjoy another super-fast and even more clever BOA Edition!

# Updated Octopus platforms:

  ### Drupal 7.24.1

  Open Atrium 2.0.9 ------------ http://drupal.org/project/openatrium
  OpenScholar 3.9.3 ------------ http://openscholar.harvard.edu

# New features and enhancements in this release:

  * Purge Cruft Machine moved to daily.sh agent and made configurable
    with _DEL_OLD_BACKUPS and _DEL_OLD_TMP per Octopus instance.

    If changed to any number greater than "0" it will automatically delete
    backups stored in the /data/disk/U/backups/ directory and in all hosted
    sites backup_migrate directories, during daily cleanup, if created more
    than X days ago, where X is a number of days defined in _DEL_OLD_BACKUPS.

    If "0" then this feature is disabled. It can't be configured via INI files,
    so you may need to submit support request if you want to customize this
    option set to 7 days by default on all hosted instances, as per our
    backups policy: https://omega8.cc/backups

    The same logic applies to _DEL_OLD_TMP which defines for how long the
    temporary files in all hosted sites files/tmp/ and private/temp/ directories
    are kept before deleting them during running daily maintenance.

  * Added sql_conversion_mode variable in the platform and site level INI
    to customize instance-wide mode optionally set via _SQL_CONVERT.

    This option allows to activate and/or customize DB tables conversion
    per site, per platform and via _SQL_CONVERT per Octopus instance.

    Supported values are: innodb and myisam (lowercase only!)
    Note that this conversion will run daily even if all tables have been
    already converted, so it will run OPTIMIZE on all tables, effectively.

    Related Issue #2126471 - Convert DB engine control files to ini format.

# Changes in this release:

  * Allow to install unsupported distros only in head, not stable.
  * Contrib update: advagg-7.x-2.3
  * Map drush to drush6 on command line. You can still use drush4 and drush5.
  * New contrib: display_cache
  * New contrib: panels_content_cache
  * Nginx 1.5.7 -- security upgrade.
  * Use dev versions of CDN module with patch for AdvAgg 7 compatibility.
  * Use Drush 5 and 6 head until next release.

# Fixes in this release:

  * Always cleanup temp downloads to avoid failed builds due to leftovers.
  * Always fix permissions on contrib on upgrade and in daily.sh agent.
  * Better auto-recovery when broken libcurl is detected.
  * Delete any tar/gz/zip files in modules|themes|libraries daily.
  * Delete dangerous local-allow.info file.
  * Display all active INI variables in HTTP headers on dev URLs.
  * Fix for cron auto-correction.
  * Fix for Feature Server broken due to incorrect context version downloaded.
  * Fix the logic for cURL install from sources.
  * Nginx: Add Access-Control-Allow-Origin header also for static .json
  * Nginx: Protect also .md files in modules|themes|libraries dirs.
  * Issue #2137583 - Permissions on the site directory are broken after running,
    how ironically, the Health Check task.
  * Issue #2138811 - Maintenance agent disables modules from its standard
    turn-off list, even if they are required by other modules, apps or features.

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to initial BOA-2.1.3 release

  ==> Updated on Fri Nov 22 11:29:34 SGT 2013 with all fixes applied to stable.

  @=> Issues which can be fixed only with `barracuda up-stable system`:

  * PHP: Fix for forced rebuild mode if lib curl is broken or updated.
  * PHP: Fix for broken cURL from sources install logic.
  * MariaDB 5.5.34 just released.

  @=> Issues which can be fixed with boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt script:

  * Issue #2141283 - Drush aliases like `drush dbup` no longer work properly.

# HotFix for known post-upgrade issues

  Run the boa-fix-upgrade script when logged in as system root:

  $ cd;rm -f boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt*
  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt
  $ bash boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt

  This script is updated once there is any new regression or bug discovered,
  so it is safe and recommended to run it again if the list of known issues
  have been updated. Note that this script will detect and fix all Octopus
  instances on your system at once.


### Stable BOA-2.1.2 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Mon Nov 18 00:03:30 SGT 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  This is primarily a bug-fix release and you should read release notes and
  also the changelog for both BOA-2.1.1 and BOA-2.1.0 for a context, especially
  if you are upgrading from BOA-2.0.9 or older release (we have tested upgrades
  from as old Editions as BOA-2.0.1, released on Dec 28 07:00:00 EST 2011).

  This Edition includes fixes for all Known Issues on systems already upgraded
  to initial BOA-2.1.1 release, plus some extra improvements and one updated
  platform (Managing News).

  Important new features include ability to use either legacy (default) or
  modern (highly recommended) version of Redis integration module.

  The reason we don't enable the modern version by default is that it may need
  some testing before using it on a complex Drupal sites. The modern version
  of Redis integration module comes with some great new features which allow
  you to configure flush mode per cache bin, with three modes available.

  Please refer to the module README for more information on all available
  advanced flush modes: http://bit.ly/1drmi35

  It also comes with super-fast lock backend, which can be enabled only when
  you are using the modern version, but still needs more improvements, so we
  auto-configure some exceptions on the fly, when it is used, to avoid known
  issues, as reported in the queue: https://drupal.org/node/2135545

  Please read also INI docs to understand how it works, and how to improve
  performance by enabling and tuning these settings: http://bit.ly/1bwfZZj

  Enjoy!

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to initial BOA-2.1.2 release

  ==> Updated on Thu Nov 21 01:28:23 SGT 2013 with all fixes applied to stable.

  * Feature Server platform is broken since BOA-2.1.0 due to incorrect context
    module version downloaded via makefile. This bug affects only some instances
    upgraded to head and not stable, but since in the first 24 hours after
    BOA-2.1.2 release our static downloads were still out of sync on two of
    our mirrors, it is safe to assume that you should run the HotFix via
    boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt anyway.

  * There is regression introduced in the maintenance agent logic, which
    results with dependency check effectively ignored. This may cause various
    disastrous effects, like disabling all modules chained via feature or
    via apps module, because apps module requires update module, which is
    normally disabled. While any feature which requires dblog or update module
    enabled is considered as a serious developer error and should be avoided,
    we have to respect all dependencies defined to never break any site by
    forcefully disabling modules.

  * Part of the Site Health Check task (the `drush6 status-report` command)
    breaks permissions on the site directory, which blocks any further tasks
    like Clone, Migrate and Backup. This regression was introduced in the
    BOA-2.1.0 release.

# HotFix for known post-upgrade issues

  Run the boa-fix-upgrade script when logged in as system root:

  $ cd;rm -f boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt*
  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt
  $ bash boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt

  This script is updated once there is any new regression or bug discovered,
  so it is safe and recommended to run it again if the list of known issues
  have been updated. Note that this script will detect and fix all Octopus
  instances on your system at once.


### Stable BOA-2.1.1 Release - Full Edition
### Date: Sat Nov  9 17:00:00 EST 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  There are some important bug fixes in this release, along with changes
  to the Auto-(En|Dis)able agent, explained in greater detail in embedded docs
  included in platform specific INI file template.

  Note that the system agent doesn't modify any existing and active INI file,
  so updated docs are included only in the updated each morning INI templates:
  default.boa_platform_control.ini and default.boa_site_control.ini

  You can find both INI templates also online at: https://omega8.cc/node/293

  We have also added some docs to help you if you experience any issues
  with cached, Views based pages and panels: https://omega8.cc/node/292

  Note also that since BOA-2.1.0 all D6 based sites are forced to use PHP 5.3.27
  on hosted and managed Aegir instances, even if they were previously configured
  to use deprecated, insecure, unstable and outdated PHP 5.2 for D6 based sites.

  This means that if you are using either too old D6 core (older than 6.28.x)
  some features will stop working, namely imagecache, /update.php and any
  feature which depends on contrib modules not yet compatible with PHP 5.3

  We have allowed to use PHP 5.2 for too long, to give enough time (in years)
  to upgrade to latest Pressflow 6.x version and we no longer can extend
  this allowance, for obvious security and systems stability reasons.

  Furthermore, sticking with PHP 5.2 would not allow us to use latest Aegir 2.x
  version (BOA still includes a bit older Aegir 2.x for backward compatibility),
  since newer Aegir versions need newer Drush (BOA still uses ancient Drush 4.6)
  and newer Drush requires newer PHP version.

  It is even more important because Drupal 8 will not run on older PHP nor Drush
  older than 7.x, so there is basically no choice other than make all your sites
  compatible with PHP 5.3, or you will miss all future BOA system upgrades.

  Now even PHP 5.3 is officially in the EOL (End-of-Live) phase, with only
  security fixes expected, but also only until July 2014 and then it will be
  completely deprecated, so we will have to switch to modern PHP 5.5, first
  introduced as an option, later this year.

  Upgrading to latest Pressflow 6.x is *very* easy. Just add all contrib modules
  you are using in your outdated 6.x platform to the latest Pressflow 6.x
  platform we provide by default, reverify the new platform, clone the site
  in the old platform, migrate the cloned copy to the new platform and if
  everything works fine, migrate also your live site. It will take less than
  15 minutes and there is absolutely no excuse to not upgrade.

  If you experience issues with your site due to the old core used on now forced
  PHP 5.3, we can temporarily revert it to PHP 5.2 for the last time, but it is
  really a bad idea. Much better idea is to find those 15 minutes and upgrade
  your site, so we could continue to provide future upgrades and new amazing
  features also for your Aegir instance.

  Enjoy new, shiny BOA Edition!

# Known Issues on systems upgraded to initial BOA-2.1.1 release

  ==> Updated on Tue Nov 12 14:44:16 EST 2013 with all fixes applied to stable.

  * Fast Redis lock may cause problems on node edit, with temporary error
    saying that the node was changed by "another user", because current
    implementation was not multisite-aware enough.

  * Views Cache Bully module, if enabled after upgrade to BOA-2.1.0, may break
    the cart and checkout on sites using Ubercart, and should be disabled
    automatically like it is done for Commerce based sites since BOA-2.1.1

  * The version of Redis integration module included: 7.x-2.3 causes warnings
    for D6 sites, visible either on dev URLs or on command line and may break
    some advanced Views configurations if custom caching is not yet enabled.
    It may also break menu updates due to not aggressive enough cache clear
    policy for cache_menu bin.

  * Permissions set daily on the civicrm.settings.php file are too restrictive
    and since provision_civicrm extension does not make this file writable
    before attempting to re-create it, as it should, all tasks on CiviCRM
    enabled sites fail.

  * Permissions on sites/all/{modules,theme,libraries} on newly added, empty
    platforms with no sites created yet, so not included in the running daily
    permissions fix, are initially not group writable, as they should be.

  * The check_if_required procedure in the running daily maintenance agent to
    detect if the module is required by any other module or feature or by
    installation profile, is 6 (six) slower than it should be and never disables
    devel module properly.

  * The running daily maintenance agent does not disable files checks for
    Drupal for Facebook (fb) and Domain Access modules as it should in the
    platform level INI file, unless those modules are detected.

# HotFix for known post-upgrade issues

  Run the boa-fix-upgrade script when logged in as system root:

  $ cd;rm -f boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt*
  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/update/boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt
  $ bash boa-fix-upgrade.sh.txt

  This script is updated once there is any new regression or bug discovered,
  so it is safe and recommended to run it again if the list of known issues
  have been updated.

  You can also run another upgrade with "barracuda up-stable system" command,
  followed by "octopus up-stable all both log" since all fixes have been applied
  to current stable as well, but boa-fix-upgrade script is faster than running
  complete upgrade again.


### Stable BOA-2.1.0 Release - Full Edition - Now NSA-proof
### Date: Sat Nov  2 18:15:19 EDT 2013
### Includes Aegir 2.x-boa-custom version.

# Release Notes:

  There are some really important changes and improvements in this release
  you should be aware of before running your BOA system upgrade.

  Even if you are on a hosted BOA system with upgrades managed for you,
  it is very important to read at least this release notes.

  And if you are more curious, read also the giant changelog further below.

  Besides all changes, fixes and improvements, all currently supported
  Drupal distributions have been upgraded to use latest Drupal core versions.

  Plus, there are seven (7) NEW platforms included!

#-### Control files to customize your BOA system per platform and per site

  Almost all control files are now replaced with two centralized,
  platform and site specific INI files, using standard PHP INI format.

  The platform specific INI file template with extensive documentation
  included, has filename default.boa_platform_control.ini and is located
  in the sites/all/modules directory.

  The site specific INI file template with extensive documentation
  included, has filename default.boa_site_control.ini and is located
  in the sites/foo.com/modules directory.

  Any existing control files, both on the platform and site level
  will be automatically converted into active INI files and then deleted
  to avoid confusion, also automatically, on the first run of the special
  maintenance script: /var/xdrago/daily.sh but defaults in the global.inc
  file will allow for smooth, fully automated transition.

  This change will improve customizing your BOA system maintainability
  and overall system performance/load thanks to minimized files checks.

#-### Empty and not used platforms auto-cleanup

  BOA has finally the ability to auto-delete, during daily maintenance,
  which happens each morning (server time zone), all empty and not used
  platforms. While on all hosted instances the TTL (time-to-live) is set
  to 60 days (counted since last verify task date/time on the platform),
  it can be configured per instance in the /root/.USER.octopus.cnf file
  by changing value of _DEL_OLD_EMPTY_PLATFORMS variable to anything
  higher than 0 (days), which is default (and means the feature is OFF).

  Note that every Octopus instance upgrade re-verifies all existing platforms,
  so if you will configure the TTL to 90 days but you will run the upgrade
  every month or every two months, no platforms will ever be deleted.

  If you wish to have this TTL customized on the hosted instance, where
  it is set to 60 (days) by default, please open a support ticket via:
  https://omega8.cc/support

  Remotely managed BOA systems can have this feature enabled and configured
  upon request submitted via https://omega8.cc/support

#-### All-in-One Site Health Check in your Aegir control panel

  You will notice a new Task available on every site page in your Aegir
  Control Panel, named "Run health check". This new task will run a few
  important tests on your site and will store all results in the Task Log,
  so you easily review all results by clicking on the "View" button to the
  right of the task, when it is complete. Make sure to check all details
  by clicking on the "Expand" links in the log.

  What are the tests included?

  1. The "drush clean-modules" command will be run for you to make sure
     there is no module left in the system table as "enabled" while it
     no longer even exists on the system. This part will utilize (behind
     the scenes) extension: https://drupal.org/project/clean_missing_modules
     If it will find any such leftover, it will clean it up, automatically.

  2. The "drush6 pm-updatestatus" command is a native Drush command which
     tells you if there are any waiting module/code updates in the site.
     Note: it will *not* upgrade anything, it is a check only.
     Of course there should be no updates waiting if you follow Aegir
     site upgrade best practices and your site's code is up to date.
     Yes, this check will automatically enable the "update" module for you,
     but it will not auto-disable it afterwards (to not break things in case
     it is required by some other module or feature).

  3. The "drush6 status-report" command is a native Drush command
     which provides you a complete overview of your site status.
     Instead of logging into the site, you can review it easily here.

  4. The "drush6 updatedb-status" command is a native Drush command
     which tells you if there are any waiting database updates in the site.
     Note: it will *not* apply these updates, it is a check only.
     Of course there should be no updates waiting if you follow Aegir
     site upgrade best practices, but who knows, hence the check.

  5. The "drush security-review" command will run only on Drupal 7 based sites
     and provides some additional information by using (behind the scenes)
     this extension: https://drupal.org/project/security_review

#-### PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) support in Nginx

  BOA now fully supports the most secure, yet still compatible with most
  used systems and browsers SSL configuration.

  All hosted BOA instances have been already upgraded automatically and
  you don't need to do anything to make it work -- it is already done
  for you -- both on any SSL enabled site with dedicated certificate
  and IP address and also on the standard, system-wide SSL proxy level,
  which is available for every hosted site -- just type HTTPS:// in the URL.

  On self-hosted instances it needs to be enabled by adding a line in your
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file: _NGINX_FORWARD_SECRECY=YES before the upgrade.
  Note that depending on the system used, it may auto-install some
  requirements like latest OpenSSL libraries and packages.

  Remotely managed BOA systems can have this feature enabled upon request
  submitted via https://omega8.cc/support

#-### SPDY (new networking protocol) support in Nginx

  BOA now fully supports the advanced, new protocol which allows to run
  sites over HTTPS with much better performance than plain HTTP.

  While not all browsers support this protocol yet, it is already enabled
  by default on all hosted BOA instances (but obviously works only when you
  access the site via HTTPS:// in the URL).

  On self-hosted instances it needs to be enabled by adding a line in your
  /root/.barracuda.cnf file: _NGINX_SPDY=YES before the upgrade.
  Note that depending on the system used, it may auto-install some
  requirements like latest OpenSSL libraries and packages.

  Remotely managed BOA systems can have this feature enabled upon request
  submitted via https://omega8.cc/support

#-### Zend OPcache replaced APC in PHP

  Newer versions of PHP already come with next generation opcode cache
  from Zend, which is now open-sourced and available also as an extension
  for older PHP versions, including 5.2 and 5.3

  BOA leverages this opportunity and now uses Zend OPcache instead of APC.

  This change is introduced automatically on all systems, both hosted
  and managed for you and also self-hosted.

  Only Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Precise systems which are using PHP
  installed from packages and not from sources, so with _BUILD_FROM_SRC=NO
  set in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file, still use APC by default.
  You can install Zend OPcache by changing it to _BUILD_FROM_SRC=YES
  before running the upgrade.

  Note that Zend OPcache default configuration caches every script for
  60 seconds, so any changes you will introduce, will be visible with
  up to 1 minute delay. However, if there is .dev. or .devel. in the site
  name, this delay is lowered automatically to just 1 second.

  You can change the default per site permanently by adding in the
  local.settings.php preferred value, for example, to set it to 10 seconds:
  ini_set('opcache.revalidate_freq', '10'); -- but remember that you will
  override default (1 second) for dev URLs using this method.

  Enjoy the most advanced, NSA-proof BOA Edition yet!

### Stable BOA-2.0.9 Release - Barracuda Edition
### Date: Thu May  9 11:25:59 EDT 2013
### Includes Aegir from BOA-2.0.8 Edition

# This is the first Barracuda-only Edition, released to address important
  security issue with Nginx server and provide system level upgrades.

  This Edition will not upgrade Aegir Master nor Aegir Satellite Instances,
  because there was no new Drupal core released since BOA-2.0.8 Edition and
  there were not enough updates to built-in platforms or contrib accumulated.

  Releasing Barracuda-only Edition separately from full Edition allows us
  to address system/services security issues without any extra delay,
  while releasing Octopus-only Edition will allow us to provide Drupal core
  or Aegir version upgrades, without affecting system level services.

  There is also another reason why separate releases will be useful.
  BOA-2.0.9 is the last Edition where Aegir 2.x still uses old Drush 4.6
  in the backend. We need to sync BOA specific Aegir 2.x with upstream
  and finally switch to Drush 5, or even Drush 6, if possible.

  This change, however, may cause issues if you still host legacy Drupal 5
  or some old Drupal 6 sites, with either core or contrib not compatible
  with PHP 5.3, which is now used by default.

  That is why we plan to introduce ability to install older/previous
  Barracuda and/or Octopus release, if you need more time to upgrade.

  * Debian 7.0 Wheezy support.
  * Automated upgrade from Squeeze with _SQUEEZE_TO_WHEEZY=YES option.

  outdated distros. We have tried to manage both security and version
  updates for some abandoned or semi-abandoned distros, to keep them
  useful for you, but since it involves increasing amount of work

  dependencies, we have decided that it is time to stop doing it,

### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.3
### Date: Thu May 17 18:17:40 EST 2012
### Installs Aegir 2.0.3 compatible with Aegir 1.9

# There are major improvements and new features added in this BOA Edition.

  Here is the description of those most important/expected, while complete
  list of all changes, new features and fixes is available further below.

  * Caching backend has been simplified. We no longer use chained cache
    system with Memcached+Redis+database. New system uses only Redis cache
    and the same configuration for all Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms.
    This new system doesn't require any extra module to be enabled in any site.
    Complete integration is already enabled by default for every platform/site
    installed by default and for every custom platform as before - the next
    day after first site on the custom platform has been created.
    You can disable this caching layer using the same modules/cache/NO.txt
    control file as before. While there is just one cache engine (Redis) used,
    there is also an automatic, instant failover to standard database caching,
    just in case Redis is not available for some reason. You can also disable
    Redis cache on the fly for debugging by adding ?noredis=1 to any URL.

  * We have added support for Drupal 8.x while still using modified
    Drush 4.6-dev version, so we can still support Drupal 5 on the same
    system, but on another Octopus instance.

  * You can choose different PHP version for PHP-FPM (web access)
    and PHP-CLI, for even greater control over compatibility with
    various Drupal major versions.

  * You can choose both PHP-FPM and PHP-CLI versions per Octopus instance,
    on the same system. And you can change those versions on upgrade.

  * Installing and upgrading BOA system has been greatly simplified.
    You can still configure and run both installers as before,
    but you can also use these new, shockingly simple command line tools
    to install Barracuda and Octopus at once, to install more Octopus
    instances, to run selective or batch upgrades of all Octopus instances etc.
    See docs/INSTALL.txt and docs/UPGRADE.txt for details.

  * We have added an 'easy install' configuration shortcuts for both
    standard (public) and localhost installs. You no longer need
    to read, understand and configure all options, unless you prefer
    to choose some non-default configuration options.

  * Default installs on Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Precise use
    packages for PHP 5.3, so initial setup takes just 10-15 minutes.

  * You can easily grant limited shell and FTPS access for developers,
    simply by creating "Clients" in the Aegir control panel and define
    them as 'owners' of one or more sites. Their access will be limited
    to only sites they can manage, but only if you will send them their
    access credentials, which are independent of their Aegir control
    panel credentials and stored in the ~/users/ directory in your main account.
    You will find there files with passwords for every "Client" with at least
    one site attached. For example ~/users/o1.username file means that
    this Client's username for SSH and FTPS access is 'o1.username' while
    his password is stored in this file. This means that SSH/FTPS access
    is not granted automatically, but you can decide who should receive it.
    How to change any extra user's password? Simply delete his ~/users/o1.username
    file and wait up to 5 minutes - the system will re-create his account
    with new password. And how to delete the user completely? Simply
    delete this user "Client" account in the Aegir control panel and allow
    the system to delete also his SSH/FTPS access in the next 5 minutes.

  * We have added segfault monitor for php-fpm and nginx, enabled by default.
    It is pretty aggressive, because it disables vhost of any site causing
    segfault errors and sends e-mail alert to the Octopus instance owner
    and server owner e-mail addresses. Simple site re-verify in Aegir enables
    the site again - but until the next segfault only, so read the info
    included in the e-mail alert message, if this will happen. If you prefer
    to not run this monitor: `rm -f /var/xdrago/monitor/check/segfault_alert`

  * Previously recommended site and platforms re-verify on Clone or Migrate
    is now fully automated. Aegir will run these extra tasks as a part
    of Clone or Migrate task, to make sure that there are no errors
    and that Aegir is using up-to-date information collected about
    platforms and sites. It also automatically fixes the known problem
    with domain aliases incorrectly written in the original and cloned sites,
    as reported in the Aegir queue: http://drupal.org/node/1004526

  * Apps are now fully supported. If the App is not downloaded yet, installing
    it via browser only requires write permissions, normally never available
    for the web server user, so you need to create an empty control file, either
    in sites/all/modules/apps-allow.info or sites/domain/modules/apps-allow.info
    and then run 'Reset password' task. It will open write access where required
    until the next site 'Verify' task will run . After installing the App,
    remember to re-Verify the site to restore default, safe permissions.

  * Custom local.settings.php file support uses similar logic with control file
    sites/domain/modules/local-allow.info and also 'Reset password' task.
    After running this task the local.settings.php file will be group writable,
    so you will be able to edit it also when logged in as limited shell user.
    Remember to run site Verify when done, to restore standard, safe permissions.
    Note that this file is created automatically, but is not open for write
    access by default.

### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.2
### Date: Thu Feb 9 14:00:00 EST 2012
### Installs Aegir 2.0.2

# Note on new and updated platforms and new Drupal core:

  All 6.x and 7.x platforms have been updated with latest core,
  so they are all in fact new in this BOA Edition, but we list here
  only really new platforms or those with new version released
  since last BOA Edition, with one exception: we list also basic
  6.24.1 and 7.12 platforms as new.

  Please note that instead of waiting for 6.25, we already
  included patches required to fix major issues with 6.24:

  http://drupal.org/node/1425868
  http://drupal.org/node/1425260

  Our Pressflow 6.24.1 +Extra version includes not only listed
  above patches, but also a few extra, performance related
  patches discussed here:

  http://groups.drupal.org/node/187209

  Note also that we renamed too basic Acquia 7.x platform to
  Ubercart 3.x platform. It is based on the same acquia install
  profile, but includes all contrib modules required for any
  basic Ubercart 3.x site.

  NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
  please read our important how-to:

  http://omega8.cc/the-best-recipes-for-disaster-139
  http://omega8.cc/are-there-any-specific-good-habits-to-learn-116

  Videola 1.0-alpha2 ----------- http://videola.tv

# New features:

  * Barracuda now supports Debian Lenny to Squeeze major upgrade.
    Of course you should create full backup image before running
    this major system upgrade, just in case, but all the rest
    is fully automated - it is enough to set advanced configuration
    option in Barracuda to _LENNY_TO_SQUEEZE=YES and run Barracuda
    as usual. It will upgrade your system to Squeeze and re-build
    everything, with almost no downtime during the upgrade.
    You will still need to reboot the server when it will complete
    all upgrades.

    Important: Debian Lenny reached EOL on February 6, 2012.
    Details: http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/2012/msg00001.html

  * All new 7.x sites now run on latest PHP-FPM 5.3.10 by default.
    For existing sites it is enough to re-verify them in your
    Aegir control panel to get them on PHP-FPM 5.3.10 automatically.

    All existing and new 5.x sites run on the old PHP-FPM 5.2.17
    version by default and you can't change that.

    You can still choose between PHP-FPM 5.2.17 and 5.3.10 for
    all your 6.x sites - just let us know via http://omega8.cc/support
    that you wish to switch to 5.3.10 - but make sure first that all
    your 6.x sites are fully PHP 5.3 compatible. By default all
    6.x sites still run on PHP-FPM 5.2.17.

    Of course you could choose 5.3.10 for 6.x sites on one Octopus
    instance and 5.2.17 on another - on the same server. Just one more
    reason to use Octopus built-in intelligence :)

    All of this works the same both for Aegir Master Instance
    and all Aegir Satellite Instances.

  * Both Speed Booster, Boost and Redis/Memcached supports separate
    caches per mobile device, so it is safe to use separate themes
    or content for mobile devices. We use simple logic to determine
    the kind of device and there are separate cache bins for
    mobile-tablet, mobile-smart and mobile-other.
    You can review it here: http://bit.ly/wYz6PG

  * Purge module is now enabled by default in all 6.x and also 7.x
    sites. Now Speed Booster works like a Boost - it expires
    immediately the cache for any node/page as soon as it has been
    edited or comment added. It also automatically expires the cache
    for the homepage and RSS feed at once. You no longer need to wait
    up to one hour for Speed Booster cache expiration. Plus, unlike
    in Boost, it purges all separate caches for all mobile devices
    along with non-mobile cache, at once. Now you have a good reason
    to disable Boost and use our crazy fast Speed Booster only.

  * You can use GeoIP data provided by your Nginx server
    in your custom code or modules with variables:
    $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE'] and $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_NAME']
    to display content or block depending on the visitor's country.
    You can check/review it from your location also on command line
    with: 'curl -I http://your-domain' - you will see GeoIP headers.

  * You can safely manage Clients/Users attached to hosted sites
    in your Aegir interface. Make sure that all sites have its
    associated Client! Otherwise the site will be listed as available
    for all Clients/Users you have added. The site can lost its
    association with Client after Clone task if there is any
    non-alphanumeric value in the Client name, like &.

  * CloudFlare specific header 'CF-Connecting-IP' is now supported
    out of the box and available as standard $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
    in all 5.x, 6.x and 7.x platforms without any contrib module.

  * You can disable both Boost and Speed Booster on the fly
    by adding ?nocache=1 to any URL. Useful for debugging.

  * Speed Booster offers now also ESI microcaching, as explained
    in this article: http://groups.drupal.org/node/197478.
    This may enhance not only anonymous visitors, but also
    logged in users experience, since it allows you to separate
    microcache for ESI/SSI includes (valid for just 15 seconds)
    from both default Speed Booster cache for anonymous visitors
    (valid by default for 3 hours, unless purged on demand via
    recently introduced Purge/Expire modules) and also from
    Speed Booster cache per logged in user (valid for 60 seconds).
    The ESI module is included in all 6.x platforms but is not
    enabled and not configured automatically, so please consult
    its documentation for details on how to use it properly.

    Now you have three different levels of Speed Booster cache
    to leverage and deliver the 'live content' experience for
    all visitors, and still protect your server from DoS or
    simply high load caused by unexpected high traffic etc.

  * Automatic configuration of options required when Barracuda
    detects _VMFAMILY=AWS (Amazon EC2).

  * Both _NGINX_WORKERS and _PHP_FPM_WORKERS are now configurable.

  * You can avoid overwriting /etc/mysql/my.cnf with empty
    control file: $ touch /etc/mysql/custom.my.cnf

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/etc/php.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /usr/local/lib/php.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/local/etc/php53.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php53.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root on upgrade
    by adding your extra/custom entries in the extra file:
    $ nano /var/xdrago/cron/custom.txt

  * You can avoid overwriting your CSF configuration on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /var/log/custom.csf.log

### Thu, 2010-09-23 17:30 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade for all pre-A14.A required)

1.  Introducing default SSL Wildcard Nginx Proxy.
    Works for all sites/hostmaster instances on
    the same server and can be used also for
    encrypted connections to Chive and Collectd.
    Doesn't interfere even with SSL enabled sites
    on the same IP (with separate certs).

2.  The redirects are now back and enhanced.
    Fully compatible with Nginx in any combination
    with aliases and SSL settings/modes.

3.  Barracuda and Octopus by default installs still
    Aegir HEAD, but the latest alpha14 also works.

4.  Octopus can define its separate IP address
    if available.

5.  Fixed issue with too aggressive Hot Sauce check,
    causing creating not shared copies of code
    for platforms on every install or upgrade.

6.  Barracuda and Octopus now allows to skip DNS
    test, to make it possible to install on any
    virtualbox with dynamic DNS/IP etc. There is
    no guarantee it will work, but another switch
    is now available, if someone needs it.

7.  Octopus can now turn off local Memcache and Redis
    caches and switch all sites to use defined remote
    caches.

8.  Forced /etc/apt/sources.list rewrite also before
    the Barracuda system upgrade.

9.  Fix for the already installed and possibly broken
    git-core.

10. Fix for Aegir sites with .info domains, the path
    alias should now work without 403 error.


### Fri, 2010-09-17 11:00 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade required)

1. Barracuda and Octopus by default installs now
   Aegir HEAD to use the fix for critical issue
   on sites import. It will be included in alpha14,
   please don't use alpha13.

2. Debian Lenny on 32bit systems works again.
   Fix for broken git-core after upgrade
   to version: 1:1.5.6.5-3+lenny3.1 on Lenny 32bit.

3. Fix and better inline warnings/info about
   missing locales at Linode and RackSpaceCloud.

4. More details in the installer log for better
   debugging and version tracking.

5. E-mail address for alerts on database repair
   started by auto-healing now correctly replaced.

6. Redis for Lenny now built from sources due to
   apt version moved already to Squeeze.

7. Critical bugfix for failed platforms install
   when hostmaster is not upgraded.

8. Introducing simple edition archive:
   http://omega8.cc/dev/bo-a14a.tar.gz

9. Octopus now better supports using newer shared
   code for platforms and introduces new setting:
   _HOT_SAUCE to allow forced fresh/hot code.


### Tue, 2010-09-12 21:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A13.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1.  Octopus now creates SSH/FTPS separate, non-aegir
    account for every Aegir Satellite Instance,
    with limited shell to avoid using commands
    like "drush up" since they should never be used
    on sites managed in the Aegir system.

2.  Octopus now by default sends a welcome e-mail
    with some useful intro information and access
    details to the address defined as _CLIENT_EMAIL.

3.  When Octopus is used the first time to create
    an Aegir Satellite Instance, it doesn't allow
    to skip installing all platforms, since it is
    recommended to add all available platforms with
    initial install, for easier re-using the code
    by next Aegir Satellite Instances.

4.  The second and all future non-core Hostmaster
    installs allow to choose one or more platforms
    or to skip adding platforms at all.

5.  Octopus by default honors initial domain used
    for the Aegir Satellite Instance on every
    upgrade to avoid mistakes with using different
    copies of the script for different Aegir
    Satellite Instances upgrades.

6.  Also Barracuda will always honor initial
    domain used for the core Hostmaster to avoid
    mistakes on upgrade when you don't use
    the original version of the script.

7.  Better checks if the script is running as root.

8.  Removed memcache module since cache is used.

9.  SMTP connection test is now optional.

10. Nginx version set to 0.8.50.

11. By default Aegir 0.4-HEAD instead of alpha13
    is now installed to fix critical issues with
    importing sites.

    See also: http://drupal.org/node/907248

12. Solr and Chive are now optional (Yes/no).

13. Added optional install of Collectd monitor.

14. Fixed issue with SSL mode.

15. Better compatibility for upgrades from
    pre-Barracuda Nginx installs.

16. Now it doesn't start cron before completing all
    install tasks to avoid breaking spinner.

17. Both Barracuda and Octopus now can better
    support re-starting stopped install/upgrade.

18. Octopus now refuses to run if defined domain
    doesn't resolve yet to the server IP address.

19. Octopus now refuses to run on system not
    created initially by Barracuda installer.

20. Custom FQDN hostname is now forced (if defined)
    in Barracuda before running DNS checks.

21. Fix for some missing mime types in vanilla Nginx.

22. Updated versions of Open Atrium, Drupal Commons
    and Cocomore Drupal distros installed by Octopus.

23. Lowered memory defaults in the MariaDB configuration.


### Tue, 2010-08-31 23:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.D

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended because it works!)

1. Upgrade of Aegir Master Instance by Barracuda
   and upgrade of Aegir Satellite Instances by Octopus
   finally works as expected.

2. It is now possible to use Barracuda to install
   environment and Aegir Master Instance, to
   upgrade only environment, to upgrade only Aegir
   Master Instance, or both at the same time.

3. Octopus now can separately install and/or upgrade
   any Aegir Satellite Instance or any platform
   on any instance, separately, using detailed prompt
   with version numbers and links to distributions
   home pages.

4. New platform Cocomore Drupal added in Octopus:
   http://drupal.cocomore.com


### Sat, 2010-08-28 20:15 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.C

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1. By default Aegir 0.4-HEAD with Drush 3.3
   is now installed to fix critical issues with
   importing sites. The fix is also available
   as a patch for alpha12:
   http://drupal.org/node/882970#comment-3382542

2. Both Barracuda and Octopus now allow to choose
   if the Aegir Hostmaster will be upgraded or not.

3. Added versions numbers and links to all platforms
   Yes/no prompts.

4. /tmp directory no longer used to avoid problems
   due to secure noexec mount.

5. Improved readme and docs (in progress).

### Fri, 2010-08-27 04:15 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade optional)

1. Octopus now allows to install or upgrade only Aegir
   Satellite Instance without any platforms added.

2. Enabled again early exit on the first error to avoid
   confusing cascade of errors if something went wrong.

3. Both Barracuda and Octopus runs now faster.


### Thu, 2010-08-26 19:30 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade from previous versions recommended)

1. Barracuda now includes multicore Apache Solr Search,
   Redis and Memcache.

2. Barracuda now can upgrade packages selectively.
   Just run it again to upgrade the system and the
   Aegir Master Instance.

3. Octopus can create many Aegir Satellite Instances
   on the same server, each with different set of platforms,
   but with ability to share the code between instances,
   so you can use this system even on the low end VPS.

4. Chive database manager added by default with db.
   subdomain (may require dns entry or wildcard).


### Thu, 2010-08-26 08:55 - Edition 0.4-alpha12-A12.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade of existing installs not required)

   see this for details: http://drupal.org/node/874716
   The default install will be reverted to 0.4-alpha10
   when it will be released. You can use 0.4-alpha9 with

   to stay safe).
