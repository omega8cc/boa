@=> New Features

   * Add support for Backdrop CMS as platform (urgent)

   * Symlink all sites files automatically to speed up migration tasks and
     to save tons of disk space.

   * Rsync sites files on clone task to create separate symlinked copy.

   * PHP 8.3 support, bringing total PHP versions supported to 10 (ten!)

   * Automate mass import procedure from remote classic Aegir servers running
     Nginx or Apache to extend xboa tool features.

   * Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 migration test and support -- required
     because Percona/MySQL 5.7 EOL already happened in October 2023.

   * Add Amazon S3 alternatives to backboa and duobackboa.

   * Debian Bookworm and Devuan Daedalus compatibility for installation and
     automated upgrades (in progress)

   * Aegir Remote Servers feature is important for some users, let's do it.

@=> Improvements

   * Update and consolidate all legacy and built-in docs into single Grav CMS
     and GIT based site for single point of reference.

@=> Changes and Upgrades

   * Switch to OpenSSL LTS 3.0 since 1.1.1 entered EOL in September 2023.

   * Switch Aegir admin interface from Drupal 7 to Backdrop CMS (urgent)

   * Sites backup in Aegir will no longer include all files nor database dump,
     but make it configurable on the fly with new control files if user wants
     to preserve Restore task functionality.

@=> Important Fixes

   * Drush 11/12 support with Redispatch to site-local Drush (vdrush, sdrush).
