Guidelines for contributing code and reporting bugs and problems with BOA.


### BUG, FEATURE AND PATCH SUBMISSION

* Active issue queue ---------- https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/issues

Reporting bugs is a great way to contribute to BOA. Mis-reporting bugs or
duplicating reports, however, can be a distraction to the development team
and waste precious resources. So, help out by following these guidelines.

!!! Every bug report must include a Gist link to output of `boa info` command.

!!! Any bug report failing to follow the guidelines will be ignored and closed.

Before reporting a bug always search for similar bug report before submitting
your own, and include as much information about your context as possible,
including your server/VPS parent system name (like Xen) and/or hosting provider
name and URL.

Please always attach the output of `boa info` command, or for more detailed
system configuration and history report, `boa info more` command.

!!! Don't post your server or error logs in the issue directly. Instead use
!!! services like http://gist.github.com and post the link in your submission.

HINT: Please enable debugging with _DEBUG_MODE=YES in the /root/.barracuda.cnf
      file before running upgrade, so it will display more helpful details.
      You can find more verbose logs in the /var/backups/ directory.

It is also a good idea to search first our deprecated issue queues for
Barracuda and Octopus projects on drupal.org:

* Legacy issue queue ---------- https://drupal.org/project/issues/barracuda
* Legacy issue queue ---------- https://drupal.org/project/issues/octopus
