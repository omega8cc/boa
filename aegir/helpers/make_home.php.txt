Or maybe you only have a few sites, and would like to spend less time on the tedious (and likely manual) tasks associated with running these Drupal sites over their entire lifetime?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="https://static.o8.io/dev/smokinfast2020.jpeg" width="600"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Solve your problems with multiple Drupal sites by running in Aegir! It\'s even easier than tweeting! Simply enter your domain or subdomain, pointed to your Aegir instance, choose an installation profile and platform, click Save, then - wait a few minutes and you\'re ready to go!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, from one web site, you can manage every other web site you\'ve created - clone it, batch-migrate to newer platforms, reset your main password - anything you want, and it\'s still the same 2-click easy task - as simple as posting a new tweet!</p><br /><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Already 900+ other hosts powering thousands of Drupal sites are running on our high-performance, Free/Libre Open Source Aegir BOA Software. BOA is an acronym of high performance Barracuda, Octopus and Aegir LEMP server stack. Barracuda installs and monitors all essential system services, while Octopus is an Aegir installer, with many popular Drupal Distributions ready to use, including: OpenLucius, Thunder, Varbase, Opigno LMS, Social, Commerce, Pressflow and Ubercart.</p><br /><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Aegir is built by a community of system administrators and developers who share Drupal deployment tools, strategies and best practices. Aegir makes it easy to install, upgrade, and backup an entire network of Drupal sites. Aegir is fully extensible, since it\'s built on Drupal and Drush.</p>';
