It\'s even easier than tweeting! Simply enter your domain or subdomain, pointed to your Aegir instance, choose an installation profile and platform, click Save, then - wait a few minutes and you\'re ready to go!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, from one web site, you can manage every other web site you\'ve created - clone it, batch-migrate to newer platforms, backup and restore, reset your main password - anything you want, and it\'s still the same 2-click easy task - as simple as posting a new tweet!</p>';
