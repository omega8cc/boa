# Richard Klien - Autocompletion, Download Size Checking (made for on ubuntu, untested on other distros)
# Patrick Kramer Ruiz - suggestions - see Suggestions.txt
# Sergio Silva - test to see if axel is installed, root detection/sudo autorun

# Use this just like apt-get for faster package downloading.

# Check for proper priveliges
