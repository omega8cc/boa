Hello,

If you are still running any Drupal site without Let’s Encrypt Free SSL
enabled in your Aegir control panel, you may want to read two articles:

  HTTPS' massive speed advantage: http://bit.ly/2b42lqV
  HTTP/2 makes media loading 3–15 times faster: http://bit.ly/2aW1u9V

The Let’s Encrypt certs are free, and very easy to use! Just follow the docs:

  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/SSL.txt

In short, here is all you need to do:

  1. Create ~/static/control/ssl-live-mode.info file, and wait a few minutes
  2. Edit any hosted site node to set SSL to "Enabled", and hit Save
  3. Repeat step #2 for every other site you host in Aegir

Congrats!

Now enjoy HTTPS with free Let’s Encrypt certs for all hosted sites, with
HTTP/2 for speed, and Perfect Forward Secrecy for security, auto-enabled!

Note: If you have used SSL add-on with dedicated IP address before,
you need to update DNS to point it to your instance default IP address,
which can be found in your (long) welcome email, in the section #2

@=> Speaking of docs. Be the change you want to see, and participate in
@=> the BOA docs rewrite: http://bit.ly/2aK0Vli - your input is welcome!

Also, your Aegir instance has been upgraded to version boa.version

  https://aegir.url.name
