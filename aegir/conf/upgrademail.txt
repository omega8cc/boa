Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.4.2

  https://aegir.url.name

This new BOA release includes 15 updated Aegir platforms,
13 new software versions, plus over 23 bug fixes and improvements.

IMPORTANT!

Please note that this is the last BOA upgrade which still allows
to run deprecated, buggy and insecure PHP 5.3 version by default.

Next BOA upgrade (2.4.3) will force PHP 5.5 on all hosted Aegir
instances, unless you will explicitly opt-out *before* that upgrade
using PHP version control files, as explained in our docs at:

  https://omega8.cc/how-to-quickly-switch-php-to-newer-version-330

We recommend that you try to switch to PHP 5.5 or even 5.6 as soon
as possible, so you could effectively detect any possible issues
with your site(s) and switch them explicitly to PHP 5.3 until
you will be able to fix problems and start using the latest,
much faster and secure PHP version.

If you will not configure PHP version as explained in our docs,
your instance will be automatically switched to PHP 5.5 during
the *next* BOA upgrade, expected in June 2015.

We recommend that you upgrade your sites using this safe workflow:

You can find all details on how to use new features, along with all
other changes explained in the release notes and changelog available at:

  https://omega8.cc/boa-242-full-edition-353

It is always highly recommended that you read extensive release notes
and changelog posted on our website for previous BOA Editions, so you
could keep track on the progress and learn more about great features
and improvements we have made over the last few years, no matter when
you have started using Aegir powered by BOA:
