Hello,

This email is very long again, but it's *very* important that you read it
and also check the links for more information, both to benefit from all new
features and also to avoid known issues.

Note that we list here some changes which could be already installed
on some BOA instances before, because this information is still relevant
and often overlooked, because who likes to read boring update emails..
but, please, make an exception now and read it in full -- you will learn
about features you could be unaware of before. Enjoy!

This BOA update provides latest PHP versions, system updates, including
security fixes, many bug fixes, latest Aegir version ..but no Aegir platforms
are installed by default anymore, unless their keywords are listed in the file:

  ~/static/control/platforms.info (please read further below for details)

(NEW!) You can now launch Aegir upgrade and (re)install any supported
Drupal platforms by creating temporary pid file:

  ~/static/control/run-upgrade.pid (please read further below for details)

TL;DR
* Yes, with little effort you can turn your subscription free of charge!
* Yes, you can launch Aegir upgrade to add supported platforms in minutes!
* Yes, blazing fast site clone/migrate mode is available even for giant sites!
* Yes, BOA still supports Pressflow 6 (LTS version only!)
* No, we no longer install any supported Drupal distros as platforms by default.
* You should stop using PHP other than 7.4 because older versions are deprecated

@=> PHP unsupported versions deprecation notice! Also, 8.0 and 8.1 is here!

While your BOA system will keep running PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 until
any of them is used by any of the sites hosted on your system, none of them are
not only actively maintained any longer, but even security updates have been
dropped for all of them (PHP 7.3 security support ended on December 6, 2021).

This BOA upgrade added support for latest PHP 8.0 and 8.1 versions.

!!! >>> PHP CAVEATS:

  => PHP 8.0 is only supported by Drupal 9.1.0 or newer
  => PHP 8.1 is only supported by Drupal 9.3.0 or newer
  => Use 8.x only for specified sites in the ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info
  => Do NOT use 8.0 nor 8.1 in the default Aegir PHP configuration files:
     ~/static/control/cli.info nor ~/static/control/fpm.info

Check also: https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/php-requirements

Please note that both Drupal 7 and our Pressflow 6 LTS version already support
PHP 7.4, although you may not be able to use PHP 7.4 if you are running some
no longer maintained contrib modules.

It's very important that you upgrade all your hosted site to newest available
Drupal core and contrib versions to avoid problems with too old PHP versions,
since they are not only no longer secure, but also way slower than the currently
supported PHP versions.

@=> Super fast site cloning and migration mode (NEW!)

It is now possible to enable blazing fast migrations and cloning even sites
with complex and giant databases with this empty control file:

  ~/static/control/MyQuick.info

By the way, how fast is the super-fast? It's faster than you would expect!
We have seen it speeding up the clone and migrate tasks normally taking
1-2 hours to... even 3-6 minutes! Yes, that's how fast it's!

This file, if exists, will enable a super fast per table and parallel DB
dump and import, although without leaving a conventional complete database
dump file in the site archive normally created by Aegir when you run
not only the backup task, but also clone, migrate and delete tasks, hence
also restore task will not work anymore.

We need to emphasise this again: with this control file present all normally
super slow tasks will become blazing fast, but at the cost of not keeping
an archived complete database dump file in the archive of the site directory
where it would be otherwise included.

Of course the system still maintains nightly backups of all your sites
using the new split sql dump archives, but with this control file present
you won't be able to use restore task in Aegir, because the site archive
won't include the database dump -- you can still find that sql dump split
into per table files in the backups directory, though, in the subdirectory
with timestamp added, so you can still access it manually, if needed.


@=> Solr 7 and Solr 4 support changes and improvements

Big improvements and changes are coming to (auto)managing Solr cores too!
Solr cores are are now created every 5 minutes if needed, instead of during
the nightly procedure only, and Solr 7 is used by default. Existing Solr 4
cores will continue to work as before, but the system will create new Solr 7
cores for all compatible sites, and will update the sites/foo.com/solr.php
accordingly.

Both Solr 7 and Solr 4 powered by Jetty 9 server are available. Supported
integration modules are limited to latest versions of either search_api_solr
(D8/Solr7 and D7/Solr7 ) or apachesolr (D7/Solr4 and D6/Solr4).

Please read for more details:
  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/SOLR.txt


@=> Drupal platforms

We no longer install any supported Drupal distros as platforms by default, but
you can customize Aegir platform list via control file, which will be used
on the next Aegir upgrade, which can be launched easily on demand:

  ~/static/control/platforms.info

This file, if exists and contains a list of symbols used to define supported
platforms, allows to control/override the value of _PLATFORMS_LIST variable
normally defined in the /root/.${_USER}.octopus.cnf file, which can't be
modified by the Aegir instance owner with no system root access.

IMPORTANT: If used, it will replace/override the value defined on initial
instance install and all previous upgrades. It takes effect on every future
Octopus instance upgrade, which means that you will miss all newly added
distributions, if they will not be listed also in this control file.

Supported values which can be written in this file, listed in a single line
or one per line:

Drupal 9 based

  OLS ----------- OpenLucius
  OPG ----------- Opigno LMS
  THR ----------- Thunder
  VBE ----------- Varbase

Drupal 8 based

  SOC ----------- Social

Drupal 7 based

  D7P D7S D7D --- Drupal 7 prod/stage/dev
  CME ----------- Commerce v.2
  DCE ----------- Commerce v.1
  GDR ----------- Guardr
  OA7 ----------- OpenAtrium
  OOH ----------- OpenOutreach
  OPO ----------- Opigno LMS
  PPY ----------- Panopoly
  UC7 ----------- Ubercart

Drupal 6 based

  D6P D6S D6D --- Pressflow (LTS) prod/stage/dev
  UCT ----------- Ubercart

You can also use special keyword 'ALL' instead of any other symbols to have
all available platforms installed, including newly added in all future BOA
system releases.

Examples:

  ALL
  VBE D7P D7S D7D


@=> Aegir self-upgrade in minutes (NEW!)

You can now launch Aegir upgrade to install platforms listed in the file
~/static/control/platforms.info by creating empty pid file:

  ~/static/control/run-upgrade.pid

This file, if exists, will launch your Aegir upgrade in just a few minutes,
and will be automatically deleted afterwards. This means that you can easily
upgrade your Aegir instance easily to install/re-install supported platforms
even if you don't have root access or are on hosted BOA system.


@=> Composer 2 support

Composer will now use PHP 7.4 by default, and you can find many useful hints at:
  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/COMPOSER.txt

IMPORTANT: You must switch your ~/static/control/cli.info to 7.3 or newer
PHP version (BOA hosted on Omega8.cc comes with 8.1, 8.0, 7.4 and 7.3), because
D8 based distros require at least PHP 7.3 -- this also means that to run
the sites installed after switching cli.info to 7.3 or newer, you will also
need to either switch your ~/static/control/fpm.info to 7.3 or newer, or
more probably, to not break any existing sites not compatible with PHP 7.3+
you will need to list these D8 sites names in ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info

Please check for more information:
  https://learn.omega8.cc/how-to-quickly-switch-php-to-newer-version-330

BOA supports Drupal 8/9 codebases both with classic directory structure like
in Drupal 7 and also Drupal 8/9 distros you can download from Drupal.org, but
if you use Composer based codebase with different structure, the platform path
is not the codebase root directory, but the subdirectory where you see the
Drupal own index.php and "core" subdirectory. It can be platform-name/web or
platform-name/docroot or something similar depending on the distro design.


@=> Important PHP versions availability changes

Still on PHP 5.6? You should switch to PHP 7.4 — It’s twice as fast as 5.6!
But don't switch blindly -- even sites already running on PHP 7.0 before
are most probably not ready for PHP 7.4 or 7.3 without proper fixes.

In addition to still supported, even if officially deprecated 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
versions, this release supports PHP 8.1, 8.0, 7.4 and 7.3

Please check the PHP officially supported versions list at:
  http://php.net/supported-versions.php

In our limited testing Drupal 7 core version included in this release works
without noticeable issues with both PHP 7.3 and 7.4, although many contrib
modules may not be ready to switch your instance to 7.4 or 7.3 just yet,
especially if you have not used PHP 7.x already.

We recommend to test your sites clones with newer PHP versions using BOA
multi-PHP-version support via ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info before
switching your instance to use 7.4 or 7.3 by default.

Please check for more information:
  https://learn.omega8.cc/how-to-quickly-switch-php-to-newer-version-330

We still include Pressflow 6 platforms, because in the meantime the LTS
community support made the latest Pressflow 6 version compatible with PHP 7.3+

If you still have a reason to use Drupal 6 core, we recommend to use
our version: https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/tree/pressflow-plus


@=> Let's Encrypt certificates

If you are still running any Drupal site without Let's Encrypt Free SSL
enabled in your Aegir control panel, you may want to read two articles:

  HTTPS' massive speed advantage: http://bit.ly/2b42lqV
  HTTP/2 makes media loading 3–15 times faster: http://bit.ly/2aW1u9V

The Let's Encrypt certs are free, and very easy to use! Just follow the docs:

  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/SSL.txt

In short, here is all you need to do:

  1. Create ~/static/control/ssl-live-mode.info file, and wait a few minutes
  2. Edit any hosted site node to set SSL to "Enabled", and hit Save
  3. Repeat step #2 for every other site you host in Aegir

Congrats!

Now enjoy HTTPS with free Let's Encrypt certs for all hosted sites, with
HTTP/2 for speed, and Perfect Forward Secrecy for security, auto-enabled!

Note: If you have used SSL add-on with dedicated IP address before,
you need to update DNS to point it to your instance default IP address,
which can be found in your (long) welcome email, in the section #2

Your Aegir instance has been just upgraded to version boa.version
