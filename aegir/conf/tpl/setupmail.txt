Hello,

Welcome to your new Aegir control panel, designed for easy Drupal multi-site deployment, development, and management.

Your Aegir control panel [version boa.version] is available at:

https://aegir.url.name

This Email Covers:
1. Logging into your Aegir control panel
2. Deploying Aegir default websites
3. Adding modules & themes
4. Managing your databases
5. Advanced user information
6. Articles and video tutorials

Please read this email thoroughly. It contains important information required to properly leverage all your available Aegir features.

----------------------------------------
1. LOGGING INTO YOUR AEGIR CONTROL PANEL
----------------------------------------

To access your control panel, use the one-time login link you will receive in a separate email.

If the one-time link no longer works, use the initial username and password sent in another email, or reset your password using your email address as your username at: https://aegir.url.name/user/password

Please double-check your spam folder to ensure all emails are delivered.

----------------------------------------
2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEBSITES
----------------------------------------

Log into the control panel and start exploring how Aegir works. We are ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions!

To create a new site:
1. Click the Add Site tab.
2. After adding a site, click the Home icon on the site's node in Aegir to access the admin area.

If the Home icon no longer links to the one-time login page, run the "Reset password" task on the site's node, and once complete, click the Home icon again.

A standard one-time login link will also be sent to your email address.

- Drupal Site Upgrade Workflow: https://omega8.cc/your-drupal-site-upgrade-safe-workflow-298

To make a site "live" using any domain name, point its A or CNAME DNS record to your Aegir instance public IP address:

yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.url.name.

For test sites, use any subdomain in *.aegir.url.name, e.g., http://atrium.aegir.url.name.

3. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes:
1. Log into your FTPS/SSH/SFTP account:

host: aegir.url.name
user: dragon.ftp
pass: FN8rXcQn
port: 21 (FTPS)
port: 22 (SSH/SFTP)

2. Type "help" when logged in via SSH to see all available shell commands.
3. Change your password via SSH with the "passwd" command every 3 months.

Note: Use Explicit TLS mode with port 21 for FTPS and port 22 for SFTP (unless your Aegir instance uses a non-standard SSH port).

Refer to Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS Clients: https://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt for more information.

----------------------------------------
4. MANAGING YOUR DATABASES
----------------------------------------

Manage your databases via the Adminer Manager web interface, using credentials available in each site's drushrc.php file:

Adminer Manager URL: https://166.84.6.231

Note: Keep the SSH session active with a continuous command (e.g., ping -i 30 google.com) to maintain database access.

Use a desktop SQL manager that supports SSH tunneling, as remote access over MySQL port 3306 is not available for security reasons. For a video tutorial, visit: http://bit.ly/om8rsql

You can also manage databases via command line with Drush commands or tools like mysql and mysqldump.

----------------------------------------
5. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------

How-To Information: Check the built-in docs in your account at ~/static/control/README.txt.

Directory Information:
- Your home directory contains subdirectories in ~/platforms for different platform releases.
- Use symlinks in ~/clients/client-name/ to find all your sites directly.

Custom Platform Information:
- Upload custom Drupal platforms to ~/static/platforms in separate subdirectories.
- Enable custom platforms via the "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Note: Only Pressflow (LTS) core-based platforms are allowed for Drupal 6.x versions; standard Drupal core can be used for Drupal 7 and newer versions.
