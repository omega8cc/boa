Hello,

Welcome to your new Aegir control panel for easy Drupal
multi-sites deployment, development and management.

Your Aegir control panel [version boa.version] is available at:

  https://aegir.url.name

Note:

  Your Aegir control panel is using self-signed SSL certificate,
  so your browser can display warning. Please add this certificate
  as accepted in your system settings to avoid displaying it
  each time you are trying to log in.

The following topics are covered within this email:

1. Logging into your Aegir control panel
2. Deploying Aegir default web sites
3. Adding modules & themes
4. Managing your databases
5. Advanced user information
6. Articles and video tutorials

Please read this email in its entirety. It contains
important information required to properly leverage
all your available Aegir features.


----------------------------------------
#1 LOGGING INTO YOUR AEGIR CONTROL PANEL
----------------------------------------

To gain access, please visit your control panel site
using one-time login link you should receive shortly
in a separate email.

Once in your control panel, you'll find a number of
Drupal platforms ready to deploy.

Note about vanilla platforms naming convention:

  Basic Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms come in three instances,
  to make your standard workflow easier for: -dev, -stage and -prod,
  with correct suffix: D.00x, S.00x and P.00x in the platform name.
  There is no difference between D/S/P, besides the name.


----------------------------------------
#2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEB SITES
----------------------------------------

The best way to get started is simply to log into the
control panel and start testing how Aegir works. We're
always ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please
don't hesitate to ask questions - we would love to help you!

Creating a new site is as easy as clicking the Add Site tab.

When you have added a site, you need to click on the Home icon on
the site's node in Aegir to access this site admin area with main
user privileges.

If this Home icon no longer links to the one-time login page, just run
the "Reset password" task on the site's node, and when the task is
complete, click on the Home icon again.

Please note that once you create any site, Aegir also sends
a standard one-time login link to your email address.

You can also use "drush @foo.com uli" command on command line
when logged in via SSH to create this one-time login link, anytime.

Use "drush aliases" command to display all existing sites aliases
and replace @foo.com with the site alias you want to work with.

Please follow our docs to import your site into Aegir properly:

  https://omega8.cc/import-your-sites-to-aegir-in-8-easy-steps-109
  https://omega8.cc/how-to-add-custom-platform-properly-140
  https://omega8.cc/your-drupal-site-upgrade-safe-workflow-298

To make a site "live" using any domain name you manage, you
need to point its A or CNAME DNS record to your Aegir instance
public IP address, like shown below:

 yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
  or
 subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.url.name.

You can also use any subdomain in *.aegir.url.name
to create test sites, for example:

  http://atrium.aegir.url.name

If you need our assistance in importing your site, please purchase
this add-on service:

----------------------------------------
#3. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes to any of the enabled platforms,
you need to log into your FTPS/SSH/SFTP account:

  host: aegir.url.name
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn
  port: 21 (for FTPS connections)
  port: 22 (for SSH and SFTP connections)

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTPS access.

Note that while your Aegir instance comes with FTPS/SSH/SFTP access,
there is no plain FTP access available, and you must use Explicit TLS
mode with standard port 21 while connecting via FTPS (FTP over SSL).
The SFTP (FTP over SSH) connections should use port 22, unless
your Aegir instance comes with non-standard SSH port.

Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 https://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.


----------------------------------------
#4. MANAGING YOUR DATABASES
----------------------------------------

You can manage your databases via Chive Manager web interface,
using access credentials (dbhost, dbname and dbpass) available
in every site drushrc.php file, located in the same directory
as your site settings.php and local.settings.php files.

Chive Manager URL: https://166.84.6.231

Note that you must be logged in via SSH and run any auto-continuos
command, for example: 'ping -i 30 google.com' to keep the access
open for your IP address, on the fly. The system will check and
update access rules every 10 seconds, so please allow 10-15
seconds to open the access after you have logged in via SSH.

You can also use any desktop SQL manager you prefer, if it
supports tunneling over standard SSH port 22, since there is
no remote access over mysql port 3306 available, for security and
performance reasons - video tutorial: http://bit.ly/om8rsql

You can also manage your databases on command line, either
with supported Drush commands or directly with tools like
mysql and mysqldump.


----------------------------------------
#5. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------

=== IMPORTANT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Your home directory shows a number of sub-subdirectories in the
~/platforms directory, each one for a different platforms release,
while each platform can include modules/themes in a separate,
standard Drupal multisite directory tree.

To make it easier to find all your sites while they are created and
migrated between different platforms, you can use automatically
updated symlinks in the ~/clients/client-name/ directory.
These symlinks always point to every site directory directly.

=== IMPORTANT CUSTOM PLATFORM INFORMATION

When logged in via FTPS or SSH you'll find also a directory
named 'static'. This is the place to upload your optional
custom Drupal platform, each in a separate subdirectory,
named in the form (for example):

 ~/static/platforms/my-green-platform
 ~/static/platforms/my-yellow-platform

When you want to enable any of those custom platforms, just use
the built-in "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Please remember to use full system paths. You can check the path
with "pwd" command when logged in via SSH.

Note that we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions, while 7.x platforms can use
standard Drupal 7 core.
