Hello,

You are receiving this notification because your Aegir hosting system
migration process to the new facility has been completed.

# Caveats:

  * New Aegir URL is listed in the new welcome email
  * New SSH/SFTP credentials are listed in the new welcome email
  * All cron tasks are paused during this migration and in the next 1-3 hours
  * The old Aegir control panel has been disabled to protect proxy vhosts
  * The main SSH account home directory contents has not been migrated
  * SSH (RSA) keys have been transferred, but only for the main SSH account
  * SSH sub-accounts (Clients), if used, will be recreated from scratch
  * The Aegir backend USER.id_rsa.pub public SSH key has changed

  * NOTE! YOUR **NEW** WELCOME EMAIL CONTAINS THE NEW DEFAULT IP ADDRESS
    of your Aegir instance in the new facility. It is recommended
    that you update DNS for all non-SSL-enabled sites as soon
    as possible, to point the traffic directly to the new servers
    and not rely on the provided proxy for too long.

  * For SSL-enabled sites with dedicated IP addresses - please
    don't update their DNS until you will receive separate email
    with new dedicated IP address to use. Your SSL certificates
    have been migrated automatically, so only DNS update will be needed
    once new IP address is provided.

  * You should use only the new SSH/SFTP credentials listed in the
    new welcome email, because this is your only access to all your
    migrated live/active sites and their files.

  * While Aegir control panel URL has changed, its access credentials
    are still the same as before, in contrast to SSH/SFTP credentials.
    This is to preserve your Aegir control panel tasks history,
    all sites<-->clients associations and domain aliases/redirects.

Kind Regards,
