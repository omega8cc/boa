You can install one Aegir Master Instance and any number of Aegir Satellite
Instances. The Master Instance holds the central Nginx configuration for all
Satellite Instances and thus shouldn't be used to host your sites. Please
always use one or more Satellite Instances to host your sites.

The 'Master' and 'Satellite' names in the Barracuda/Octopus context are not
related to the multi-server Aegir features. It is related to the multi-instance
environment, with virtual chroot/jail for every Aegir Satellite instance.

Barracuda is the main script for the Aegir Master Instance system install and
upgrades, including OS environment and main Aegir instance, but no platforms
(besides hostmaster) are installed there.

Octopus is an Aegir + Platforms installer (you can interactively choose
the platforms you wish to install on the instance) and updater only. It allows
to install new versions of platforms with clean directory structure, with code
shared between all created instances, so one vanilla Octopus instance is using
only 35 MB, while most of the code, which is over 1400 MB in total, is shared.

Sharing the code between instances is of critical importance, because it allows
you to dramatically lower RAM and CPU usage, because most of the actively used
code is opcode cached.

With multi-install system you have to remember that all of them will use the
same Nginx server, so you could break the system trying to install site with
the same domain on two or more instances. The instances will not be aware of
other running instances, so it is your responsibility to use such system wisely.

There is also Tuner script available (see aegir/tools/BOND.sh.txt) for easy
system tuning for development and switching it back easily to the standard
production settings.
