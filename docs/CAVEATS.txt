NOTE: BOA maintainers currently use only Debian based 64bit systems/servers.
      We don't use and rarely test Ubuntu, so for best results please use
      Debian 8 Jessie 64bit.

NOTE: BOA maintainers use only server (public) install mode and rarely test
      localhost (local) mode, which is considered highly experimental,
      while server (public) mode is considered stable and fully supported.

NOTE: By VMware we mean the system, not the company or its hosted service,
      the vCloud Air, which is known to cause serious issues for Drupal
      in general, which are not related to anything in BOA. The vCloud Air
      has a major flaw which breaks many Drupal features, including
      images derivatives, AdvAgg and any other module which requires
      that the site can connect to itself via its public IP address.
