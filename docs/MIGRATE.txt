@=> How to migrate all sites between remote BOA servers and Octopus instances

  While docs/REMOTE.txt provides a how-to for per-site migration between
  remote Octopus instances, it depends on some assumptions, namely:

  1. Remote Octopus instance must already exist
  2. Remote Octopus instance must use the same system username
  3. You need to either add proxy manually or hurry to update DNS
  4. There is no batch mode

  New BOA tool (xboa), which is expected to mature into more sophisticated
  Swiss Army Knife for BOA, resolves all those problems, very easily.

  The only requirement is that the remote BOA server should be installed
  with the same release/version. No Octopus instance is needed on the target
  system prior to migration.

  It's a very safe and reliable (used in production) method when you need to:

  1. Upgrade to a newer major OS version w/o the fear that things will totally
     explode when running the system upgrade 'in place', like in this example:
     https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/issues/627

  2. Move to a different provider without any visible interruption to your
     hosted sites visitors, especially when you have so many sites, so
     manual procedure is not an option.

  3. Just change the machine powering your BOA, magically, on the fly.

@=> The steps you need to follow are listed below

  The 'source-host' is a placeholder for the source system FQDN hostname
  The 'target-host' is a placeholder for the target system FQDN hostname
  The 'source-ip'   is a placeholder for the source system IP address
  The 'target-ip'   is a placeholder for the target system IP address

  While it is really easy when you have some experience with the procedure,
  we don't recommend to use it on any live system without prior practicing
  a bit on a test VPS instances.

@=> Before you begin

  For Drupal 6 based sites which are configured to block IPs you may need
  to whitelist source-ip at /admin/user/rules first, by adding the Allow
  rule for Host rule type. Otherwise the site may block its old IP address
  and you will be forced to remove it via Chive from the {access} table.

@=> On the target-host
  echo "source-ip # Legacy Proxy" >> /etc/csf/csf.allow
  echo "source-ip # Legacy Proxy" >> /etc/csf/csf.ignore
  csf -q

@=> On the source-host
  xboa pre-mig source-host

@=> On the target-host
  xboa pre-mig source-host

@=> On the source-host
  ### test connection to target
    ssh root@target-ip
    exit
  ### enable site_readonly globally
    cp -af /data/conf/global.inc /data/conf/global.inc.bak
    echo >> /data/conf/global.inc
    echo "\$conf['site_readonly'] = 1;" >> /data/conf/global.inc
    echo >> /data/conf/global.inc
    grep site_readonly /data/conf/global.inc

@=> On the source-host
  xboa create o1 target-ip

@=> On the target-host
  service cron stop
  chmod 644 /data/all/cpuinfo
  (then wait 5 minutes)

@=> On the source-host
  xboa export o1 target-ip
  xboa transfer shared target-ip
  xboa transfer o1 target-ip

@=> On the target-host
  ln -sf /bin/websh /bin/sh
  ls -la /bin/sh
  xboa import o1 target-ip
  service nginx reload
  xboa post-mig
  service cron start

@=> On the source-host
  xboa proxy o1 target-ip
  service nginx reload
  xboa post-mig
