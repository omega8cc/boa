# Notes related to Barracuda install on public server with or w/o _EASY_PUBLIC option

  NOTE: 123.45.67.89 below is a placeholder for your server public, real IP address.

  NOTE: If your outgoing SMTP requires using relayhost, define _SMTP_RELAY_HOST first.

  NOTE: Chive, SQL Buddy and Collectd will work only if chive. sqlbuddy. and cgp.
        subdomains point to your IP (we recommend using wildcard DNS to simplify it).
        But don't worry, you can add proper DNS entries for those subdomains later,
        if you didn't enable wildcard DNS before running Barracuda installer.
        Only system hostname must have proper DNS configuration before installing Barracuda.


# Notes related to Barracuda install on localhost with option _EASY_LOCALHOST=YES

  NOTE: With _EASY_LOCALHOST=YES option (not enabled by default) Barracuda will configure
        your local DNS and hostname automatically. No external DNS configuration needed.

        automatically only services listed below:

# Notes related to Barracuda and Octopus customized install and upgrades

  NOTE: While BOA system installed per docs/INSTALL.txt comes with many options
        set by default to make it as easy as possible, you may want to customize
        it further on upgrade, by editing various settings stored in the BOA config
        files, respectively:

        /root/.barracuda.cnf
        /root/.o1.octopus.cnf
        /root/.o2.octopus.cnf
        etc.

        It may be useful when you prefer to install Percona instead of MariaDB
        or to always use latest version of PHP built from sources etc.
        Please read docs/UPGRADE.txt for simple upgrades how-to.
