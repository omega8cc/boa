        See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/UM2nRb

        only services listed below:

  NOTE: If your outgoing SMTP requires using relayhost, define _SMTP_RELAY_HOST first.

  NOTE: Adminer, Chive, SQL Buddy and Collectd will work only if adminer. chive. sqlbuddy.
        and cgp. subdomains point to your IP (we recommend using wildcard DNS to simplify it).
        But don't worry, you can add proper DNS entries for those subdomains later,
        if you didn't enable wildcard DNS before running Barracuda installer.
        Only system hostname must have proper DNS configuration before installing Barracuda.


# Notes related to Barracuda install on localhost with _EASY_SETUP=LOCAL

  NOTE: With _EASY_SETUP=LOCAL option (not enabled by default) Barracuda will configure
        your local DNS and hostname automatically. No external DNS configuration needed.

# Notes related to Barracuda and Octopus customized install and upgrades

  NOTE: While BOA system installed per docs/INSTALL.txt comes with many options
        set by default to make it as easy as possible, you may want to customize
        it further on upgrade, by editing various settings stored in the BOA config
        files, respectively:

        /root/.barracuda.cnf  - check docs/cnf/barracuda.cnf template
        /root/.o1.octopus.cnf - check docs/cnf/octopus.cnf template
        /root/.o2.octopus.cnf - check docs/cnf/octopus.cnf template
        etc.

        Please read docs/UPGRADE.txt for simple upgrades how-to.
