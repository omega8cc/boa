### Support for optional Drupalgeddon daily checks on all hosted D7 sites
###
### ~/static/control/drupalgeddon.info
###
### Previously enabled by default, now requires this control file to still
### run daily, because it may generate some false positives not always possible
### to avoid or silence, so it no longer makes sense to run this check daily,
### especially after BOA has run it automatically for a month and finally even
### disabled automatically all clearly compromised sites.
###
### Note that your system administrator may still enable this with root level
### control file /root/.force.drupalgeddon.cnf, so it will still run, even
### if you will not create the Octopus instance level empty control file:
### ~/static/control/drupalgeddon.info
###
### Please note that current version of Drupalgeddon Drush extension needs
### the 'update' module to be enabled to avoid even more false positives,
### so BOA will enable the 'update' module temporarily while running this
### check, which in turn will result with even more emails notices sent
### to the site admin email, if these notices are enabled.
