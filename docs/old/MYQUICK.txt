### Super fast site cloning and migration
###
### It is now possible to enable blazing fast migrations and cloning even sites
### with complex and giant databases with this empty control file:
###
### ~/static/control/MyQuick.info
###
### By the way, how fast is the super-fast? It's faster than you would expect!
### We have seen it speeding up the clone and migrate tasks normally taking
### 1-2 hours to... even 3-6 minutes! Yes, that's how fast it's!
###
### This file, if exists, will enable a super fast per table and parallel DB
### dump and import, although without leaving a conventional complete database
### dump file in the site archive normally created by Aegir when you run
### not only the backup task, but also clone, migrate and delete tasks, hence
### also restore task will not work anymore.
###
### We need to emphasise this again: with this control file present all normally
### super slow tasks will become blazing fast, but at the cost of not keeping
### an archived complete database dump file in the archive of the site directory
### where it would be otherwise included.
###
### Of course the system still maintains nightly backups of all your sites
### using the new split sql dump archives, but with this control file present
### you won't be able to use restore task in Aegir, because the site archive
### won't include the database dump -- you can still find that sql dump split
### into per table files in the backups directory, though, in the subdirectory
### with timestamp added, so you can still access it manually, if needed.
