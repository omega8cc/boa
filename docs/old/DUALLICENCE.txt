@=> DUAL LICENSE (updated on April 3, 2024) -- read also: ROADMAP.txt

  While all BOA code is Free/Libre Open Source, only the BOA LTS branch
  and Aegir itself is free of charge without limits, while BOA PRO branch
  will require valid license, with an effective date of April 8, 2024.

  From now on BOA project will be maintained in four branches:

  * LTS which remains completely free to use without any kind of license
    as it was from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE).
    This branch should be considered as BOA LTS with slow updates, focused
    on both security and bug fixes, but very limited new features additions.

  * DEV which requires paid license for both install and upgrade and includes
    the latest features, security and bug fixes and installed services versions.
    This branch shouldn't be used in production without extensive testing.

  * PRO which requires paid license and is available only as an upgrade
    from either LTS or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE) is the branch with regular
    monthly or bi-monthly releases, closely following tested DEV branch.

  * OMM which will remain our private branch with some things we donâ€™t use
    removed and some added, but generally simplified for easier maintenance
    and modern coding standards.

  The pricing will be announced at https://omega8.cc/licenses shortly.
