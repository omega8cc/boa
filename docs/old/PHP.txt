Aegir version provided by BOA is now fully compatible with PHP 8.0 and 8.1,
so both can be used as default versions in the Aegir PHP configuration files:
~/static/control/cli.info and ~/static/control/fpm.info

###
### Support for PHP-FPM version switch per Octopus instance (also per site)
###
### ~/static/control/fpm.info
###
### This file, if exists and contains supported and installed PHP-FPM version,
### will be used by running every 2-3 minutes system agent to switch PHP-FPM
### version used for serving web requests by this Octopus instance.
###
### IMPORTANT: If used, it will switch PHP-FPM for all Drupal sites
### hosted on the instance, unless multi-fpm.info control file also exists.
###
### Supported values for single PHP-FPM mode which can be written in this file:
###
### 8.3
### 8.2
### 8.1
### 8.0
### 7.4
### 7.3
### 7.2
### 7.1
### 7.0
### 5.6
###
### NOTE: There must be only one line and one value (like: 8.1) in this file.
### Otherwise it will be ignored.
###
### NOTE: if the file doesn't exist, the system will create it and set to the
### lowest available PHP version installed, not to the system default version.
### This is to guarantee backward compatibility for instances installed
### before upgrade to BOA-4.1.3, when the default PHP version was 5.6,
### as otherwise after the upgrade the system would automatically switch such
### accounts to the new default PHP version which is 8.1, and this could break
### most of the sites hosted, never before tested for PHP 8.1 compatibility.
###


###
### It is now possible to make all installed PHP-FPM versions available
### simultaneously for sites on the Octopus instance with additional
### control file:
###
### ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info
###
### This file, if exists, will switch all sites listed in it to their
### respective PHP-FPM versions as shown in the example below, while all
### other sites not listed in multi-fpm.info will continue to use PHP-FPM
### version defined in fpm.info instead, which can be modified independently.
###
### foo.com 8.1
### bar.com 7.4
### old.com 5.6
###
### NOTE: Each line in the multi-fpm.info file must start with main site name,
### followed by single space, and then the PHP-FPM version to use.
###


###
### Support for PHP-CLI version switch per Octopus instance (all sites)
###
### ~/static/control/cli.info
###
### This file, while similar to fpm.info, if exists and contains supported
### and installed PHP version, will be used by running every 2-3 minutes
### system agent to switch PHP-CLI version for this Octopus instance, but
### it will do this for all hosted sites. There is no option to switch this
### or override per site hosted.
###
### Supported values which can be written in this file:
###
### 8.3
### 8.2
### 8.1
### 8.0
### 7.4
### 7.3
### 7.2
### 7.1
### 7.0
### 5.6
###
### There must be only one line and one value (like: 8.1) in this control file.
### Otherwise it will be ignored.
###
### NOTE: if the file doesn't exist, the system will create it and set to the
### lowest available PHP version installed, not to the system default version.
### This is to guarantee backward compatibility for instances installed
### before upgrade to BOA-4.1.3, when the default PHP version was 5.6,
### as otherwise after the upgrade the system would automatically switch such
### accounts to the new default PHP version which is 8.1, and this could break
### most of the sites hosted, never before tested for PHP 8.1 compatibility.
###
### IMPORTANT: this file will affect only Drush on command line and Drush
### in Aegir backend, used for all tasks on hosted sites, but it will not
### affect PHP-CLI version used by Composer on command line, because Composer
### is installed globally and not per Octopus account, so it will use system
### default PHP version, which is, since BOA-5.0.0, PHP 8.1 and can be
### changed only by changing system default _PHP_CLI_VERSION in the file
### /root/.barracuda.cnf and running barracuda upgrade.
