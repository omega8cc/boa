### Even faster site cloning and migration
###
### It is now possible to speed up the already blazing fast migrations and
### cloning with this empty control file:
###
###  ~/static/control/FastTrack.info
###
### This file, if exists, will drastically reduce the number of tasks otherwise
### launched automatically in preparation for clone and migrate, namely:
###
###  1. Both source and target platforms will no longer be verified
###  2. The site will no longer be verified before running clone or migrate
###
### Please carefully consider implications, though, because there are very good
### reasons for these extra tasks to be launched before running clone or migrate
### to make sure that any issues are detected and fixed for you early and not
### during migration or clone, which could otherwise break the site and leave it
### in some state not easy to fix, especially without root access to the system.
###
### The potential reasons to disable these extra tasks with the help of
### this new control file can be twofold:
###
###  1. To restore default and much faster Aegir own behaviour
###  2. To help those running mass migrations to avoid running duplicate tasks
###
### Still, it's your responsibility to run these extra verify tasks when you
### need to migrate or clone just single site, but you prefer to have them run
### for you automatically as before, you can easily restore previous behaviour:
###
###  1. Create empty ~/static/control/ClassicTrack.info
###  2. Delete ~/static/control/FastTrack.info
