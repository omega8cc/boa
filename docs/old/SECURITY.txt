@=> SECURITY

With multi-Aegir-instance system you have to remember that all of them will use
the same Nginx server, so you could affect others trying to install site with
the same domain on two or more instances. The instances will not be aware of
other running instances, so it is your responsibility to use such system wisely.

It's also critically important to never give anyone access to Aegir system user
on any Octopus instance, because it comes with almost root access to *all* sites
databases hosted across all Octopus instances on the same BOA server. Only
the limited shell access accounts and non-admin Aegir control panel accounts
should be ever provided for your end-users.

### Option in /root/.barracuda.cnf
###
### _PHP_FPM_DENY=""
###
### You can define custom list of functions
### to disable besides those already denied
### in the system level 'disable_functions'.
###
### Note: If this option is left empty, BOA
### will deny access also to function:
###
###   passthru
###
### If _PHP_FPM_DENY is *not* empty, its value
### will *replace* default 'passthru', so any
### denied function must be listed explicitly.
###
### WARNING! Do not add here 'shell_exec'
### or you will break cron for all sites
### including all hosted on all Satellite
### Instances. The 'shell_exec' function is
### also required by Collectd Graph Panel,
### if installed.
###
### This option affects only Aegir Master
### Instance plus all scripts running outside
### of Octopus Satellite Instances.
###
### Example:
###
### _PHP_FPM_DENY="passthru,popen,system"
###
### Note that while it will improve security
### it will also break modules which rely
### on any of disabled functions.
###

### Option in /root/.USER.octopus.cnf
###
### _PHP_FPM_DENY=""
###
### You can define custom list of functions
### to disable besides those already denied
### in the system level 'disable_functions'.
###
### Note: If this option is left empty, BOA
### will deny access also to function:
###
###   passthru
###
### If _PHP_FPM_DENY is *not* empty, its value
### will *replace* 'passthru', so any denied
### function must be listed explicitly.
###
### Note that while it will improve security
### it will also break modules which rely
### on any of disabled functions.
###
### This option affects only this Satellite
### Instance. It is not affected by the same
### option set in the Barracuda Master.
###
### Example:
###
### _PHP_FPM_DENY="system,exec,shell_exec"
###

### Option in /root/.barracuda.cnf
###
### _STRICT_BIN_PERMISSIONS=YES
###
### We highly recommend to enable this option
### to improve system security when certain
### PHP functions, especially: exec, passthru,
### shell_exec,system,proc_open,popen are not
### disabled via option _PHP_FPM_DENY above.
###
### WARNING! This option is very aggressive
### and can break any extra service or binary
### you have installed which BOA doesn't
### manage and the binary has system group
### set to 'root'. BOA will not touch any
### binary which has non-root group or has
### setgid or setuid permissions.
###
### Recommended setting:
###
### _STRICT_BIN_PERMISSIONS=YES
###
