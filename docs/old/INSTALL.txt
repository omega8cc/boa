### Notes on available BOA branches and licenses
###

 => BOA is available in three main branches, but only LTS for installation:

  * LTS which remains completely free to use without any kind of license
    as it was from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE).
    This branch should be considered as BOA LTS with slow updates, focused
    on both security and bug fixes, but very limited new features additions.

  * DEV which requires paid license for both install and upgrade and includes
    the latest features, security and bug fixes and installed services versions.
    This branch shouldn't be used in production without extensive testing.

  * PRO which requires paid license and is available only as an upgrade
    from either LTS or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE) is the branch with regular
    monthly or bi-monthly releases, closely following tested DEV branch.

 => You can install only BOA LTS and optionally upgrade to PRO with license
    from https://omega8.cc/licenses


###
### IMPORTANT NOTE!
###

* Since Debian is running systemd, it should be removed before installing BOA,
  which involves simple autoinit procedure, as outlined further below.

* BOA requires minimal, supported OS, with no services installed.
  The only acceptable exceptions are: sshd and mail servers.

* Don't run any installer via sudo. You must be logged in as root directly.

* Don't run any system updates nor modifications with apt before running
  BOA autoinit. You should use vanilla system provided by your host.


###
### Installing BOA system on a public server/VPS
###

1. Configure your domain DNS to point its wildcard enabled A record to your
   server IP address, and make sure it propagated on the Internet by trying
   `host server.mydomain.org` or `getent hosts server.mydomain.org` command
   on any other server/system.

   See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/UM2nRb

   NOTE! You shouldn't use anything like "mydomain.org" as your hostname.
         It should be some **subdomain**, like "server.mydomain.org".

   You **don't** need to configure your hostname (on the server) before
   running BOA installer, since BOA will do that for you, automatically.

2. Please read docs/NOTES.txt for other related details.

3. Download and run BOA Meta Installers.

   $ wget -qO- http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt | bash

4. Prepare your system by removing systemd and upgrading to Devuan 5 Daedalus
   from any compatible Debian version -- Buster, Bullseye or Bookworm.

   $ autoinit

   NOTE: You can omit this step and run boa install as explained the step 5.
         It will record your command, run autoinit for you and then will run
         your boa install command automatically. Once complete, you should
         receive an email from the system with all output details logged.

   NOTE: It's recommended that you simply wait 10 minutes and then log back in
         to inspect autoinit logs to make sure there is a line at the bottom
         saying: "Time for reboot and then you can run boa install"

         $ cat /root/.autoinit.log

         There's also a verbose log of what happened if you are interested:

         $ cat /root/.autoinit-verbose.log

5. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: always start with screen session!

   $ screen

   You must specify the version of install with {in-lts|in-dev} plus kind with
   {local|public}, your hostname and email address, as shown further below.

   Specifying Octopus username is optional. It will use "o1" if empty.

   The last {newrelickey|php-8.1|php-min|php-max|nodns} part is optional and
   can be used either to install New Relic Apps Monitor (you should replace
   the "newrelickey" keyword with a valid license key), or to define single PHP
   version to install and use both for Aegir Master and Satellite instances.

   When "php-min" is defined, then 4 versions will be installed: 8.3, 8.2, 7.4
   plus 8.1, configured as default. You can later install or modify PHP version
   used via _PHP_MULTI_INSTALL, _PHP_CLI_VERSION and _PHP_FPM_VERSION, but the
   _PHP_SINGLE_INSTALL variable must be set empty to not override other related
   variables. The "nodns" option allows to skip DNS and SMTP checks.

   You can enable much more verbose reporting in the console during installation
   and upgrades for either barracuda or octopus (or both with -boa-) by adding
   these control files before running installation/upgrade:

   $ touch /root/.debug-barracuda-installer.cnf (read the caveats below)
   $ touch /root/.debug-octopus-installer.cnf
   $ touch /root/.debug-boa-installer.cnf

   NOTE: You should never use /root/.debug-barracuda-installer.cnf unless you
         need to debug barracuda without running the Aegir Master Instance
         upgrades, because this file will automatically turn off updating
         system Drush and the Aegir Master Instance on barracuda upgrade.

         Interestingly, while /root/.debug-boa-installer.cnf enables debugging
         mode for both barracuda and octopus, it will not prevent Aegir Master
         Instance and Drush updates.

   Examples:

   # Barracuda and Octopus with 4 PHP versions in silent non-interactive mode
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 php-min silent

   # Barracuda and Octopus with all 10 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 php-max

   # Barracuda and Octopus with 1 PHP version
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 php-8.3

   # Barracuda and Octopus with New Relic and 4 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 newrelickey

   # Barracuda without Octopus with 4 PHP versions in silent non-interactive mode
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email system

   NOTE: Since BOA no longer installs all bundled Aegir platforms during
         initial system installation, you will need to add some keywords
         to ~/static/control/platforms.info and run Octopus upgrade to have
         these platforms added as explained in the docs you can find in the
         file ~/control/README.txt within your Octopus account.


###
### Installing more Octopus instances
###

   You can add more Octopus instances easily:

   $ boa in-octopus my@email o2 lts

   Like above but in silent non-interactive mode:

   $ boa in-octopus my@email o2 lts silent


###
### Installing BOA system on localhost (old feature, needs work and testing)
###

1. Please read docs/NOTES.txt

2. Download and run BOA Meta Installers.

   $ wget -qO- http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt | bash

3. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-lts|in-dev},
   mode with {local|public}, and your email address, as shown below.
   For local installs you don't need to specify hostname and
   Octopus username, as it is fully automated.

   You can also specify PHP version to install, as shown in examples below.

   # Barracuda and Octopus
   $ boa in-lts local my@email

   # Barracuda and Octopus with 10 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts local my@email php-max

   # Barracuda and Octopus with 4 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts local my@email php-min

   # Barracuda and Octopus with single PHP version
   $ boa in-lts local my@email php-8.1
