@=> How to add local proxy on the same (TLS/SNI) or dedicated IP address

  BOA provides an easy to use tool to generate correct proxy vhosts
  for either dedicated IP addresses or default IP address in the TLS/SNI mode.

  Note: The proxy vhosts can reside on the same or remote BOA system, when
  the target IP address is hosted on a different system than the proxy.

  The steps are almost the same for boths options, as shown below, and the only
  difference is that for proxy listening on the default IP address, both the
  dedicated_ip and target_ip columns should list the same, default IP address.

@=> Prepare the certificate and the private key files

  1. Paste your private SSL key in the file /etc/ssl/private/{domain_name}.key

  2. Paste your SSL certificate and all intermediate certificates (bundles)
     below it in the file /etc/ssl/private/{domain_name}.crt

  Don't use 'www.' prefix in the {domain_name}.crt filename, just the domain.

@=> Verify that the dedicated IP is active (if expected to be used)

  Make sure that your system already has the extra IP address activated,
  if expected to be used. Otherwise Nginx will fail to start!

  To check if it is active, type as root:

  $ hostname -I | grep dedicated_ip

  If the output is empty, stop here and set up your networking properly first,
  so the dedicated IP will be listed. Explaining how to set up networking
  is beyond the scope of this how-to -- please consult your hosting provider
  docs and support for assistance, if needed.

@=> Generate HTTPS and HTTP proxy vhosts

  1. Create a config file: /root/.ssl.proxy.cnf with one record per line:

      domain_name target_ip o1 foo@email dedicated_ip
      domain_name target_ip o2 bar@email dedicated_ip

    All fields are required and must be separated with a single space.

    Make sure that 'domain_name' in the {domain_name}.key and {domain_name}.crt
    filenames matches the 'domain_name' in the respective domain first column
    in the /root/.ssl.proxy.cnf config file.

    To add HTTPS+HTTP proxy on the same IP address, just use the same IP address
    both for 'target_ip' and 'dedicated_ip' columns in the respective record.

    You can generate both dedicated and TLS/SNI proxy vhosts at the same time.

  2. Finally run as root:

    $ xboa ssl-gen

  3. Point the 'domain_name' DNS to 'dedicated_ip' if different than 'target_ip'

@=> How to enable permanent redirect to HTTPS

  Edit /var/aegir/config/server_master/nginx/pre.d/{domain_name}_pln_proxy.conf

  Make sure that redirect regex location lists all aliases you want to
  redirect to the HTTPS permanently, as shown in the example below:

  ###
  ### Optional permanent redirect to HTTPS per domain/regex
  ###
  if ($host ~* ^(www\.)?((foo|bar)\.com)$) {
    rewrite ^ https://$host$uri? permanent;
  }

  Make sure that all dots in all aliases are escaped, as shown above.

  Note: When using TLS/SNI mode with single default IP address, if you plan
  to use aliases other than www.{domain_name} which is added automatically,
  you will need to add them also in the 'server_name' line in both the
  {domain_name}_pln_proxy.conf and {domain_name}_ssl_proxy.conf vhosts.
