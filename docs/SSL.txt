BOA-3.1.0 release opens a new era in SSL support for all hosted Drupal sites.
The old method of creating SSL proxy vhosts is officially deprecated,
as explained in this document further below.

* How it works?

  BOA leverages letsencrypt.sh utility to talk to Letsencrypt.org servers,
  and on the Aegir side it's using new `hosting_le` extension, which replaces
  self-signed SSL certificates generated by Aegir with Let's Encrypt ones.
  You can find more information on both at these URLs:

    https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh
    https://github.com/omega8cc/hosting_le

* How to add Letsencrypt.org SSL certificate to hosted site?

  In your Aegir control panel please go to the site's node Edit tab, then
  under `SSL Settings > Encryption` choose either `Enabled` or `Required`,
  if you want to enable HTTP->HTTPS redirection on the fly. Now click `Save`
  and wait until you will see the Verify task completed. Done!

  NOTE: SSL Settings are not available in the Add Site form, only in Edit.

* How to add Letsencrypt.org SSL certificate to the Aegir Hostmaster site?

  !!! WARNING
  !!! ###===>>> Don't enable SSL option for the Hostmaster site in Aegir
  !!! WARNING

  Let’s Encrypt SSL for Aegir control panel is handled in BOA outside of
  the control panel, and you should never enable it within control panel.

  During octopus upgrade you will see this message, explaining what to do:

    BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: Letsencrypt SSL initial mode: DEMO
    BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- No real SSL certs will be generated
    BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- To enable live SSL mode, please delete file:
    BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- /data/disk/o1/tools/le/.ctrl/ssl-demo-mode.pid
    BOA [02:44:59] ==> UPGRADE B: LE -- Then run octopus forced upgrade

* How to modify/renew Letsencrypt.org SSL certificate for SSL enabled site?

  When you modify aliases or redirections, Aegir will re-create the SSL
  certificate on the fly, to match current settings and aliases to list.

  BOA runs auto-renewal checks for you weekly, and forces renewal if there is
  less than 30 days to the certificate expiration date (Let’s Encrypt certs
  are valid for up to 90 days before they have to be renewed).

  Also every Verify task against SSL enabled site runs this check on the fly.

* Are there any requirements, limitations or exceptions?

  Yes, there are some:

  * Let's Encrypt leverages TLS/SNI, which works only with modern browsers
  * Let's Encrypt doesn't support wildcard names
  * Let's Encrypt doesn't support IDN names (for now)
  * All aliases must have valid DNS names pointing to your server IP address
  * Even with aliases redirection enabled all aliases are listed as SAN names
  * Avoid renaming SSL-enabled sites; move aliases between site's clones instead
  * Before you rename a site, disable SSL first; then re-enable once it's renamed

  NOTE: The Subject Alternative Names (SAN) is a feature which allows to issue
  multi-domain / multi-subdomain SSL certificates -- it is automated in BOA.

  Let's Encrypt API for live, real certificates has its own requirements
  and limits you should be aware of. Please visit their website for details:

    https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

  To make this new BOA feature easy to test before you will be ready to
  generate real, live SSL certificates, BOA comes with Let's Encrypt demo
  mode enabled by default, so it will not hit limits enforced for live,
  real Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. It allows to generate "fake" certs,
  similar to self-signed certificate used in BOA by default.

  NOTE: All sites with one or more keywords (listed below) in the site's
  main name, or in their redirection target, if used, will be ignored,
  and they will receive only self-signed SSL certificates generated by Aegir,
  once you will switch their SSL settings to `Enabled` or `Required`.

    `.(dev|devel|temp|tmp|temporary|test|testing|stage|staging).`

  Examples: `foo.temp.bar.org`, `foo.test.bar.org`, `foo.dev.bar.org`

  NOTE: This exception rule doesn't apply to aliases which are not used
  as a redirection target. Even aliases with listed special keywords in their
  names will be listed as SAN entries, as long as they are valid DNS names.

* How to enable live mode?

  It is enough to delete the `[aegir_root]/tools/le/.ctrl/ssl-demo-mode.pid`
  control file and run Verify task on any SSL enabled site again.

  NOTE: If you are on hosted BOA, please create an empty control file instead:
  ~/static/control/ssl-live-mode.info and then wait a few minutes before
  running Verify task. It is a one-time operation, and even if you will delete
  this control file later, the system will not switch your instance back to
  Let's Encrypt demo mode.

  You could switch it back and forth to demo/live mode by adding and deleting
  the control file, and it will re-register your system via Let's Encrypt API,
  but we have not tested how it may affect already generated live certificates
  once you will run the switch many times, so please try not to abuse
  this feature.

  It is important to remember that once you will switch the Let's Encrypt mode
  to demo from live, or from live to demo, by adding or removing the
  `[aegir_root]/tools/le/.ctrl/ssl-demo-mode.pid` control file, it will not
  replace all previously issued certificates instantly, because certificates
  are updated, if needed, only when you (or the BOA system for you during its
  daily maintenance, if used) will run Verify tasks on SSL enabled sites.

  These BOA specific Verify tasks are normally scheduled to run weekly,
  between Monday and Sunday, depending on the first character in the site's
  main name, so both live and demo certificates may still work in parallel
  for SSL enabled sites until it will be their turn to run Verify and update
  the certificate according to currently set Let's Encrypt mode.

  NOTE: You may find some helpful details in the Verify task log -- look for
  lines with `[hosting_le]` prefix.

* How to replace Let's Encrypt certificate with custom certificate?

  1. Create an empty control file (replace `example.com` with your site name):

     `[aegir_root]/tools/le/.ctrl/dont-overwrite-example.com.pid`

  2. Replace `privkey.pem` symlink with single file containing your custom
     certificate key -- use `privkey.pem` as a filename in the directory:

     `[aegir_root]/tools/le/certs/example.com/`

  3. Replace `fullchain.pem` symlink with single file containing your custom
     certificate and all intermediate certificates beneath it -- use
     `fullchain.pem` as a filename in the same directory:

     `[aegir_root]/tools/le/certs/example.com/`

  4. Run Verify task for your site in the Aegir control panel. Done!

  NOTE: If you are on hosted BOA, you don't have an access to this location
  on your system, so please open a ticket at: https://omega8.cc/support

* How to replace existing custom certificates with Let's Encrypt certificates?

  Here are the steps to start using Let's Encrypt certificates on sites
  previously running SSL on dedicated IP as well as shared (default) IP via
  legacy `xboa ssl-gen` command:

  1. Disable all HTTPS redirects, if configured within these sites.

  2. Update DNS for domains using custom certificates to point them to default
     instance/server IP address, if they have used dedicated IP before,
     and run the `service nginx reload` command once DNS update is propagated.

  3. Move away previous HTTP/HTTPS proxy vhosts for those sites, if they
     still exist in the /var/aegir/config/server_master/nginx/pre.d/ directory,
     but only if they already use the default IP address, and reload nginx.

  4. Create an empty ~/static/control/ssl-live-mode.info file and wait 5 min.

  5. Enable SSL in Aegir for those sites.

  NOTE: If you are on hosted BOA, all you need to do are steps: 1, 2, 4 and 5
  from the list above. You don't need to reload nginx, move vhosts, etc.


NOTE ###===>>>

The old how-to attached below is still useful if you prefer to use SSL
termination separated from your Aegir system, or if you don't want to use
built-in Letsencrypt.org SSL certificates support (available since BOA-3.1.0).

But if you can use Letsencrypt.org SSL certificates, or you are willing to use
also built-in BOA feature which allows you to replace Letsencrypt.org SSL
certificate with any third-party certificate per site, while still managing SSL
via Aegir control panel (for redirects, forced/required SSL mode), we highly
recommend to use Aegir built-in SSL support, which is enabled and ready to use
in all Octopus instances since BOA-3.1.0 release.

@=> How to add local proxy on the same (TLS/SNI) or dedicated IP address

  BOA provides an easy to use tool to generate correct proxy vhosts
  for either dedicated IP addresses or default IP address in the TLS/SNI mode.

  Note: The proxy vhosts can reside on the same or remote BOA system, when
  the target IP address is hosted on a different system than the proxy.

  The steps are almost the same for both options, as shown below, and the only
  difference is that for proxy listening on the default IP address, both the
  dedicated_ip and target_ip columns should list the same, default IP address.

  IMPORTANT!

  The 'domain_name' is a placeholder for domain name without any prefixes.
  Please don't include 'www.' prefix. If you have a wildcard certificate,
  don't use the *. prefix in front of 'domain_name'. If you have a multi-domain
  certificate, use any domain or subdomain listed in the certificate, but make
  sure to not include any prefix.

@=> Prepare the certificate and the private key files

  1. Paste your private SSL key in the file /etc/ssl/private/{domain_name}.key

  2. Paste your SSL certificate and all intermediate certificates (bundles)
     below it in the file /etc/ssl/private/{domain_name}.crt

  For more related technical hints check also: https://omega8.cc/ssl-order

@=> Verify that the dedicated IP is active (if expected to be used)

  Make sure that your system already has the extra IP address activated,
  if expected to be used. Otherwise Nginx will fail to start!

  To check if it is active, type as root:

  $ hostname -I | grep dedicated_ip

  If the output is empty, stop here and set up your networking properly first,
  so the dedicated IP will be listed. Explaining how to set up networking
  is beyond the scope of this how-to -- please consult your hosting provider
  docs and support for assistance, if needed.

@=> Generate HTTPS and HTTP proxy vhosts

  1. Create a config file: /root/.ssl.proxy.cnf with one record per line:

      domain_name target_ip o1 foo@email dedicated_ip
      domain_name target_ip o2 bar@email dedicated_ip

    All fields are required and must be separated with a single space.

    Make sure that 'domain_name' in the {domain_name}.key and {domain_name}.crt
    filenames matches the 'domain_name' in the respective domain first column
    in the /root/.ssl.proxy.cnf config file.

    To add HTTPS+HTTP proxy on the same IP address, just use the same IP address
    both for 'target_ip' and 'dedicated_ip' columns in the respective record.

    You can generate both dedicated and TLS/SNI proxy vhosts at the same time.

  2. Finally run as root:

    $ xboa ssl-gen

  3. Point the 'domain_name' DNS to 'dedicated_ip' if different than 'target_ip'

@=> How to enable permanent redirect to HTTPS with dedicated IP

  Edit /var/aegir/config/server_master/nginx/pre.d/z_{domain_name}_pln_proxy.conf

  Add the extra if{} pseudo-location within the server{} configuration block.

  Make sure that regex in the first line lists all aliases you want to
  redirect to the HTTPS permanently, as shown in the example below:

  ###
  ### Optional permanent redirect to HTTPS per domain/regex
  ###
  if ($host ~* ^(www\.)?((foo|bar)\.com)$) {
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  }

  Make sure that all dots in all aliases are escaped, as shown above.

@=> How to enable permanent redirect to HTTPS with single IP

  While it is not possible to force HTTPS-only mode on the Nginx level in this
  case because the site doesn't have separate IP and we can't add effectively
  duplicate vhost for plain HTTP proxy, you can add in the local.settings.php
  file the PHP code shown below:

  // redirect start
  $base_url = 'https://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
  $request_type = ($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https') ? 'SSL' : 'NONSSL';
  if ($request_type != "SSL" && isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) {
    if (!preg_match("/(?:x-progress-id|ahah|filefield_nginx_progress\/*|tinybrowser|f?ckeditor)/", $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']) &&
        !preg_match("/(?:tinymce|flowplayer|jwplayer|videomanager|autocomplete|ajax|batch|js\/.*)/", $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']) &&
        !preg_match("/(?:x-progress-id|ahah|filefield_nginx_progress\/*|tinybrowser|f?ckeditor)/", $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']) &&
        !preg_match("/(?:tinymce|flowplayer|jwplayer|videomanager|autocomplete|ajax|batch|js\/.*)/", $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])) {
      header('X-Accel-Expires: 1');
      header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");
      header("Location: https://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
      header("Connection: close");
      exit;
    }
  }
  // redirect end
