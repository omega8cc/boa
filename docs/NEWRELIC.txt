### Support for New Relic monitoring with per Octopus instance license key
###
### ~/static/control/newrelic.info
###
### This new feature will disable global New Relic monitoring by deactivating
### server-level license key, so it can safely auto-enable or auto-disable it
### every 5 minutes, but per Octopus instance -- for all sites hosted on
### the given instance -- when a valid license key is present in the special
### new ~/static/control/newrelic.info control file.
###
### Please note that valid license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string
### that New Relic provides when you sign up for an account.
###
### To disable New Relic monitoring for the Octopus instance, simply delete
### its ~/static/control/newrelic.info control file and wait a few minutes.
###
### Please note that on a self-hosted BOA you still need to add your valid
### license key as _NEWRELIC_KEY in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file and run
### system upgrade with at least 'barracuda up-lts' first. This step is
### not required on Omega8.cc hosted service, where New Relic agent is already
### pre-installed for you.
