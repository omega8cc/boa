### Notes on available BOA branches and licenses
###

 => BOA is available in three main branches, but only LTS for installation:

  * LTS which remains completely free to use without any kind of license
    as it was from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE).
    This branch should be considered as BOA LTS with slow updates, focused
    on both security and bug fixes, but very limited new features additions.

  * DEV which requires paid license for both install and upgrade and includes
    the latest features, security and bug fixes and installed services versions.
    This branch shouldn't be used in production without extensive testing.

  * PRO which requires paid license and is available only as an upgrade
    from either LTS or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE) is the branch with regular
    monthly or bi-monthly releases, closely following tested DEV branch.

 => You can install only BOA LTS and optionally upgrade to PRO with license
    from https://omega8.cc/licenses


###
### IMPORTANT NOTE!
###

* Since Debian is running systemd, it should be removed before installing BOA,
  which involves procedure in five steps, as outlined further below.

* Once BOA is fully installed, you have to run 'barracuda up-lts system'
  (immediately, but without reboot) to make sure that your system is ready
  for production use. Otherwise there will be incomplete web, dns etc. setup,
  which will cause unexpected problems until you will run barracuda upgrade.

* BOA requires minimal, supported OS, with no services installed.
  The only acceptable exceptions are: sshd and mail servers.

* Don't run any installer via sudo. You must be logged in as root directly.

* Don't run any system updates with apt before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Once OpenSSH is installed on barracuda upgrade, the server keys will change,
  so you will need to remove relevant lines from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  file and accept new key.

  The next time you will ssh-in, you will see error or it may look like this:

  $ ssh root@server.ip
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
  @ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
  (...)
  Add correct host key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
  Offending ECDSA key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts:51
  ED25519 host key for my.host has changed and you have requested strict checking.
  Host key verification failed.

  How to remove/fix this warning?

  You can either edit the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file on your computer and
  remove only the offending line (51 in the example above), or if you have
  just one or two entries in this file, just delete it, so it will be
  re-generated on the next SSH login attempt once you accept the new SSH key.


### Installing BOA system on a public server/VPS

1. Configure your domain DNS to point its wildcard enabled A record to your
   server IP address, and make sure it propagated on the Internet by trying
   `host server.mydomain.org` or `getent hosts server.mydomain.org` command
   on any other server/system.

   See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/UM2nRb

   NOTE! You shouldn't use anything like "mydomain.org" as your hostname.
         It should be some **subdomain**, like "server.mydomain.org".

   You **don't** need to configure your hostname (on the server) before
   running BOA installer, since BOA will do that for you, automatically.

2. Please read docs/NOTES.txt for other related details.

3. Download and run BOA Meta Installers.

   $ cd;rm -f BOA*
   $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt
   $ bash BOA.sh.txt

4. Remove systemd in five steps:

   S1. Run 'boa init' command -- it will install sysvinit.
   S2. Reboot the server.
   S3. Run 'boa init' again so it can remove systemd.
   S4. Reboot the server again.
   S5. Run boa standard install command, as outlined below.

5. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: always start with screen session!

   $ screen

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-lts|in-dev}
   location with {local|public}, your hostname and email address, as shown
   further below.

   Specifying Octopus username is optional. It will use "o1" if empty.

   The one before last part {ask|mini|max|none} is optional, if you wish
   to control Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below.
   Note that "none" is a special option you can use to not install any
   built-in platform, while "ask" is a default mode if you don't specify
   this option at all.

   The last {newrelickey|php-8.1|php-min|php-max|nodns} part is optional and
   can be used either to install New Relic Apps Monitor (you should replace
   the "newrelickey" keyword with a valid license key), or to define single PHP
   version to install and use both for Master and Satellite instances.

   When "php-min" is defined, then only 3 versions will be installed: 8.2, 7.4,
   plus 8.1, configured as default. You can later install or modify PHP version
   used via _PHP_MULTI_INSTALL, _PHP_CLI_VERSION and _PHP_FPM_VERSION, but
   the _PHP_SINGLE_INSTALL variable must be set empty to not override other
   related variables. The "nodns" option allows to skip DNS and SMTP checks.

   Examples:

   # Latest on server - no Aegir platforms + install all 9 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 none php-max

   # Latest on server - no Aegir platforms + install 3 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 none php-min

   # Latest on server - some Aegir platforms + single PHP version
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 mini php-8.1

   # Latest on server - prompt for every platform install + 3 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1

   # Latest on server - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 only + 3 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 mini

   # Latest on server - no prompt all platforms + New Relic + 3 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 max newrelickey


### Installing BOA system on localhost

1. Please read docs/NOTES.txt

2. Download and run BOA Meta Installers.

   $ cd;rm -f BOA*
   $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt
   $ bash BOA.sh.txt

3. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-lts|in-dev},
   location with {local|public}, and your email address,
   as shown below. For local installs you don't need to specify
   hostname and Octopus username, as it is fully automated.

   The last {ask|mini|max|none} part is optional, if you wish to control
   Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below.

   You can also specify PHP version to install, as shown in examples below.
   The {php-8.1|php-min|php-max} argument can be either added
   after {ask|mini|max|none} or specified instead of {ask|mini|max|none}

   # Latest on localhost - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-lts local my@email

   # Latest on localhost - prompt for every platform + install 9 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts local my@email php-max

   # Latest on localhost - prompt for every platform + install 3 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts local my@email php-min

   # Latest on localhost - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 only + single PHP version
   $ boa in-lts local my@email mini php-8.1

   # Latest on localhost - no prompt all platforms + 3 PHP versions
   $ boa in-lts local my@email max

### Installing more Octopus instances

It is possible to add lts or dev Octopus instances w/o
forcing Barracuda upgrade, plus optionally with no platforms added by default:

   $ boa {in-octopus} {email} {o2} {mini|max|none} {lts|dev}
