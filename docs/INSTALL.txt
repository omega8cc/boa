### IMPORTANT!

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root or `sudo -i` first.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!


### Installing BOA system on a public server/VPS

1. Configure your domain DNS to point its wildcard enabled A record to your
   server IP address, and make sure it propagated on the Internet by trying
   `host server.mydomain.org` or `getent hosts server.mydomain.org` command
   on any other server/system.

   See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/UM2nRb

   NOTE! You shouldn't use anything like "mydomain.org" as your hostname.
         It should be some **subdomain**, like "server.mydomain.org".

   You **don't** need to configure your hostname (on the server) before
   running BOA installer, since BOA will do that for you, automatically.

2. Please read docs/NOTES.txt for other related details.

3. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ cd;wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt;bash BOA.sh.txt

4. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-stable|in-head|in-legacy},
   location with {local|public}, your hostname and e-mail address,
   as shown below.

   Specifying Octopus username is optional. It will use "o1" if empty.

   The one before last part {ask|mini|max|stock} is optional, if you wish
   to control Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below.
   Note that none === "ask" which is default.

   The special "stock" option allows you to install non-BOA, vanilla
   Aegir 2.x version, useful **only** for testing/debugging, but it will
   automatically force in-head install. If not sure, don't even try this,
   because most of the time it will be (probably) broken.

   The last {newrelickey} part is optional, if you wish to install
   and auto-magically enable both New Relic Apps and Server Monitor.
   It must be a valid New Relic license key - even if it is their
   free Lite option.

   # Stable on public server - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1

   # Stable on public server - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 + Atrium only
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 mini

   # Stable on public server - no prompt with all platforms and New Relic
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 max newrelickey

   To install HEAD instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-stable" with "in-head"

   To install Legacy version instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-stable" with "in-legacy"

   The Legacy version is currently the last Edition in the 2.1.x series, and
   will move gradually to 2.2.x series when 2.3.x will be released. It still
   supports Drupal 5 and uses Drush 4 along with older Aegir version.

   Note that once you will install current Stable or HEAD, you can't
   downgrade back to Legacy version!


### Installing BOA system on localhost

1. Please read docs/NOTES.txt

2. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

  $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt
  $ bash BOA.sh.txt

3. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-stable|in-head},
   location with {local|public}, and your e-mail address,
   as shown below. For local installs you don't need to specify
   hostname and Octopus username, as it is fully automated.

   The last {ask|mini|max} part is optional, if you wish to control
   Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below - none is
   the same as "ask".

   # Stable on localhost - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-stable local my@email

   # Stable on localhost - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 + Atrium only
   $ boa in-stable local my@email mini

   # Stable on localhost - no prompt with all platforms installed
   $ boa in-stable local my@email max

   To install HEAD instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-stable" with "in-head"

   To install Legacy version instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-stable" with "in-legacy"

   The Legacy version is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series which still
   supported Drupal 5 and used Drush 4 along with older Aegir version.
   Note that once you have current stable or head installed, you can't
   go back to legacy version.


### Installing more Octopus instances

You can either run OCTOPUS.sh.txt directly or just run the same boa command
again with new usernames - it will run Barracuda upgrade first and then
new Octopus instance install - automatically.

Example:

   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o2 mini
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o3
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o4 max
