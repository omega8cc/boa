### Using Drush on systems running BOA-5.2.0 or newer
###


The BOA-5.2.0 version introduced major improvements to the way Drush can be used
while preserving all previously available features.

Here are a couple of highlights, with details explained further below:

1. Aegir no longer removes local drush from any platform
2. PHP-CLI version for command line can be switched instantly
3. Using any standalone Drush newer than 8 is deprecated
4. Drush 8 is still available as either drush8 or just drush
5. Drush 10 is still available as standalone drush10
6. Drush 11 is still available as standalone drush11
7. Drush 12 is present but does not work as standalone
8. Read about CAVEATS, they are important too


@=> Site Local Drush is preserved and fully supported

The most important improvement is that Aegir no longer removes local copy of
Drush in the platform once you run platform Verify task.

Instead, Aegir only locks permissions on the vendor/drush directory, if present.

This allows to easily unlock local Drush with new task available on the platform
node in the Aegir control panel named Unlock Local Drush, which is now a
required step before you try to use local Drush or run any update with Composer
on command line.

Since Drush Launcher is no longer supported and working, it has been removed.

We are still working on a replacement for accounts using Limited Shell without
Bash access, to make using site-local Drush easier.


@=> PHP-CLI version configuration is much smarter

The second most important improvement is that switching PHP version for Drush
on command line is now instant and managed *independently* of the Aegir backend
own PHP-CLI version. Here’s how it works:

The classic ~/static/control/cli.info is still respected on command line as the
default version affecting not only Aegir backend tasks but also Drush — and now
also Composer!

But to configure PHP-CLI version to be used on command line with Drush and
Composer you can also use independent and new configuration system based on
empty control files:

  ~/static/control/php83.info
  ~/static/control/php82.info
  ~/static/control/php81.info
  ~/static/control/php80.info
  ~/static/control/php74.info
  ~/static/control/php73.info
  ~/static/control/php72.info
  ~/static/control/php71.info
  ~/static/control/php70.info
  ~/static/control/php56.info

!!! NOTE: These files will switch PHP version used *instantly*, unlike the
classic ~/static/control/cli.info which requires 3 minutes to take effect.

!!! ALSO: The highest version wins if there is more than one such file.

!!! HOWEVER: Some older PHP versions may no longer be available on your system,
because BOA automatically deactivates versions not used by any hosted site.
If you need to restore some older PHP version previously available, please open
a support ticket with your BOA host, or, if you have root access, run
`barracuda php-idle enable` command. If you want to re-install all supported
but disabled PHP versions, please run `barracuda up-lite php-max` command.
For more details run `barracuda help` command.


@=> CAVEATS

* When using standalone drush8, drush10 or drush11, please use Drush Aliases —
we don’t test anything running standalone Drush commands in the site directory
anymore — it’s probably an old habit which should be avoided for standalone
Drush — also because it may and will clash with local Drush if also present.

* Note that Drush Alias name for the site with drush10 is different than for
drush8 — all dots in the site name should be replaced with hyphens and only
the last dot before domain last extension should be a dot.
Example: drush8 @sub.domain.top.org becomes drush10 @sub-domain-top.org

* On every Aegir / Octopus upgrade all platforms are automatically verified
and thus local Drush is by default locked again in all existing platforms.


@=> STOP using Standalone System Drush 10 and 11

Why using standalone system Drush other than Drush 8 is deprecated, even if
still possible?

All post-8 Drush versions up to 11 could theoretically be used as standalone
(on command line but not with Aegir) if their numerous dependencies matched
the managed Drupal site codebase.

However, most of the time you will find that some dependencies shared by Drupal
and Drush 10+ will clash if you will try to use Drush in the standalone, system
mode, because Composer can’t track their compatibility when you use Drush
not included in the Drupal platform own codebase.

This makes using standalone system versions of Drush 10+ very frustrating
experience and sometimes even impossible.

Please add local Drush to your Drupal codebase with Composer and use it
instead of system-wide drush10 and drush11 to avoid headaches.

BOA still provides standalone drush10 and drush11, though, because we still need
them to convert Drush 8-type site aliases into Drush 10+ type sites aliases,
but otherwise these standalone Drush versions are of little use.

By the way, due to constant dependencies versions updates you could get pretty
different versions of the same Drush 10+ release installed depending on *when*
you have installed it. Sometimes they will be too old and sometimes too new for
the Drupal codebase in question. This makes using them as standalone a
completely unpredictable mess.

That’s also why Drush 12 has been officially announced as the first version
which can’t be used as standalone at all — no matter how hard you would try.
We still try, though, because we already have good track record on making
impossible — possible, like hosting Drupal 10 on Drush 8 based Aegir.
Watch this space.
