### How to customize/override standard rewrites and locations in Nginx
#
# NOTE: Since BOA-2.0.4 all listed below options are available
#       both for Satellite and Master Aegir Instances.
#
# You can include your custom rewrites/locations configuration
# to modify or add some custom settings taking precedence
# over other rules in the main Nginx configuration.
#
# Note that some locations will require using parent literal location
# to stop searching for / using other regex based locations.
#
# To learn more please read:
# http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location
#
# Your custom include file should have filename: nginx_vhost_include.conf
# for standard overrides and/or nginx_force_include.conf for high level
# overrides. The difference between both options is only the point
# where the extra config file is included, thus nginx_force_include.conf
# can override more than nginx_vhost_include.conf file.
#
# Both include points: http://bit.ly/WlOQRy and http://bit.ly/UrfDwu
#
# Nginx will look for both files in the include directory specified below:
#
# For Satellite Instances:
# /data/disk/EDIT_USER/config/server_master/nginx/post.d/
#
# For Master Instance:
# /var/aegir/config/includes/
#
# These files will be included if exist and will never be modified
# or touched by Aegir Provision backend system.
#
# Note: your custom rewrite rules will apply to *all* sites
# on the same Aegir Satellite Instance, unless you will use
# site/domain specific if{} embedded locations, as shown
# in the examples below.
