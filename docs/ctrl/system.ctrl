You can modify some system defaults on the fly by using control files,
which will affect either some system-wide services, maintenance agents
behaviours and/or all hosted Aegir instances, so these controls belong
to the system root, and are located, if needed, in the root home directory.

These system-level control files use .cnf file extension, so for extra
clarity we will list here also some other .cnf files which either have
special purpose or should never be edited, because they are managed
by the BOA install and upgrade tools exclusively.


 ### The .cnf file to never touch

 @=> /root/.my.cnf

  This is a mysql specific file, which holds your database server
  master (root) password. This file allows you to access your db server
  with root privileges when you are logged in as a system root without
  the need to type mysql root password. It also allows various BOA specific
  maintenance agents to monitor your system status and perform auto-healing,
  databases maintenance, repairs and backups.

  By the way, there is also directly associated /root/.my.pass.txt file
  which includes mysql root password generated. You should never touch
  nor modify this file as well.


 ### Special purpose .cnf files

 @=> /root/.barracuda.cnf

  This is your BOA system master configuration file. Please read its
  template in docs/cnf/barracuda.cnf for more information.

 @=> /root/.USER.octopus.cnf

  This is your Octopus Satellite instance configuration file. If you have
  more Octopus instances, you have a separate file per instance, where
  the USER is a keyword for the instance main system account. Please read
  its template in docs/cnf/octopus.cnf for more information.

 @=> /root/.ip.protected.vhost.whitelist.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to whitelist IP addresses (one valid IP per line)
  for access to vhosts protected via valid shell login (chive, cgp, sqlbuddy).


 ### All other (empty) .cnf control files

 @=> /root/.mysqladmin.monitor.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to log the output of `mysqladmin proc` command
  in the /var/xdrago/log/mysqladmin.monitor.log file, every 5 seconds.

 @=> /root/.fast.cron.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to speed up the Aegir tasks and sites cron queues
  on all hosted Octopus instances, so instead of runing every minute, it will
  run every 10 seconds. Note that while it may be handy during development,
  it will cause higher system load, even with its built-in prevention from
  running more than two concurrent queues, so it is not recommended to use on
  production systems.

 @=> /root/.force.drupalgeddon.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to force running drupalgeddon checks daily
  on all Octopus instances, even if they are not enabled with instance level
  control file ~/static/control/drupalgeddon.info

 @=> /root/.force.sites.verify.cnf

  This file, if exists, will result with all sites hosted on all Octopus
  instances on the same BOA system being re-verified daily. Note that it works
  only if _PERMISSIONS_FIX=YES is set in /root/.barracuda.cnf (default)

 @=> /root/.enable.newrelic.sysmond.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to run newrelic-sysmond service, otherwise
  disabled for security reasons, because it exposes too much system level
  information/details in the New Relic control panel.

 @=> /root/.use.local.nameservers.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to use original (or custom) nameservers
  provided on the system install by your hosting provider. It will automatically
  configure pdnsd server to use these IPs instead of public Google DNS servers.

  It depends on existence of another file with custom name servers to use
  listed, one per line: /var/backups/resolv.conf.vanilla -- for example:

    nameserver 12.34.56.78
    nameserver 12.34.56.00

  The change will take effect on barracuda upgrade.

 @=> /root/.use.default.nameservers.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to revert pdnsd cache server configuration
  to use Google DNS again (which is BOA default).

  Note that to restore default DNS cache configuration on barracuda upgrade,
  you must delete the /root/.use.local.nameservers.cnf file, if still exists.

 @=> /root/.hr.monitor.cnf

  This file, if exists, enables more aggressive Nginx abuse guard mode and
  is recommended on systems often attacked by spambots and/or aggressive
  crawlers with false UA identity.

 @=> /root/.no.fpm.cpu.limit.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to disable aggressive php-fpm processes
  monitoring and killing if any is using really too much CPU power.

 @=> /root/.no.sql.cpu.limit.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to disable mysql processes monitoring
  and restarting mysql server if any is using really too much CPU power.

 @=> /root/.no.swap.clear.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to skip the otherwise default procedure
  designed to clear system (memory) swap hourly.

 @=> /root/.no.sysctl.update.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to skip /etc/sysctl.conf update procedure
  designed to adjust it on every barracuda upgrade, if needed.

 @=> /root/.mysql.yes.new.password.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to automatically generate random, new mysql
  root password on every barracuda upgrade. This file is ignored if
  /root/.mysql.no.new.password.cnf file also exists. Warning: this may cause
  problems reported at: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/issues/642

 @=> /root/.mysql.no.new.password.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to ignore /root/.mysql.yes.new.password.cnf
  for backward compatibility and configuration consistency -- by default
  BOA (since 2.4.4) doesn't change mysql root password.

 @=> /root/.redis.no.new.password.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to skip the otherwise default procedure
  designed to generate new Redis password on every barracuda upgrade.

 @=> /root/.allow.mc.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to open an access for all limited shell users
  to the Midnight Commander (mc) -- a file manager available on command
  line, a Unix clone of Norton Commander known in the ancient DOS days.

  While very useful for novice users, can affect your system access separation
  because it doesn't respect built-in virtual chroot/jail enforced normally
  both in the limited shell and in SFTP via MySecureShell. Do not use it,
  unless you don't open shell access for untrusted users.

 @=> /root/.high_traffic.cnf

  Recommended if you have a very busy site(s) hosted. It prevents PHP-FPM
  restarts when the system detects segfault. It also allows to skip daily Redis
  restarts. Note that unlike before, even without this file, PHP-FPM will not
  be restarted at midnight, thanks to some improvements elsewhere in the
  self-healing procedures.

 @=> /root/.giant_traffic.cnf

  Recommended if you have an extremely busy site(s) hosted. It prevents
  the Speed Booster (Nginx) cache cleanup (for entries older than 1 day),
  which happens hourly. However, even with very busy sites hosted, it will be
  very rarely needed, since the cleanup procedure has been improved
  to not cause load spikes, even under "Giant Traffic" pressure.

 @=> /root/.skip_cleanup.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to skip all daily cleanup otherwise run via
  /var/xdrago/graceful.sh -- it works like /root/.giant_traffic.cnf and
  additionally disables /tmp/ and /opt/tmp/ cleanup and Jetty restart.

 @=> /root/.skip_duplicity_monthly_cleanup.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to skip forced duplicity backup cleanup,
  which is otherwise run at the beginning (randomly 1-5) of each month.

 @=> /root/.randomize_duplicity_full_backup_day.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to randomize duplicity full backup schedule,
  which is otherwise set to run on Sunday for backboa and Saturday for
  duobackboa. The full backup day (Mon-Sun) will be randomized monthly or
  one-time if /root/.skip_duplicity_monthly_cleanup.cnf file exists.
  This feature is useful when you have many VM/BOA instances running
  on the same machine.

 @=> /root/.home.no.wildcard.chmod.cnf

  This file, if exists, allows to avoid setting restrictive (but recommended)
  permissions on all directories in the /home/* directory tree, where normally
  non-system users have their account home directories.

  Without this file the system will run 'chmod 700 /home/*' every 5 minutes.

 @=> /root/.my.optimize.cnf

  This file, if exists, will enable non-standard procedure during nightly
  (global) databases backup, which normally starts at 1:18 AM.

  It will run 'OPTIMIZE TABLE foo;' on every table in every database.

  While it usually allows to defragment and shrink the binary space used
  by database tables, it may easily cause serious I/O load and subsequent
  system load (and slowdown) if you happen to host many sites on a weak
  VPS or machine with slow disks or not fast enough CPU etc.

  It will also restart database server once all tables in all databases
  are optimized.

  Note: this is a system-wide setting.

  There is a similar option: _SQL_CONVERT (defaults to NO), available in every
  Octopus instance /root/.USER.octopus.cnf file, which has very similar purpose,
  because it will trigger automatic 'to-innodb' or 'to-myisam' smart conversion
  performed via 'sqlmagic' tool, and since it uses the 'ALTER TABLE' command,
  in turn it performs auto-optimization on the fly.

  This optional conversion starts every Saturday at 2:58 AM and runs until
  the agent completes all tasks included in the /var/xdrago/daily.sh script.

  If _SQL_CONVERT=NO is set, the conversion mode can be individually enabled
  and more precisely configured with variable:

    sql_conversion_mode

  if set in the site and/or platform level, active INI files:

    boa_platform_control.ini
    boa_site_control.ini

  More info: https://omega8.cc/node/293

  Please note that if you will change it to _SQL_CONVERT=YES, the system will
  ignore sql_conversion_mode variables set in the active INI files, and instead
  will force conversion to InnoDB format in all sites hosted on this instance.

  By the way, conversion to MyISAM format will still keep some tables at InnoDB,
  and exceptions are defined with regex:

  (cache_[a-z_]+|cache|sessions|users|watchdog|accesslog)

 @=> /root/.upstart.cnf

  This is rarely needed file, which allows to skip stopping cron during
  barracuda upgrade to limit downtime for any running services, so it allows
  the auto-healing to run all the time. Note that it may break upgrade
  if the auto-healing will act too fast to bring up a service which is
  stopped and started during the upgrade.
