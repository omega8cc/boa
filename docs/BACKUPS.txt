  BOA supports automated, encrypted daily backups to your Amazon S3 bucket.

  * This new feature is available on self-hosted BOA and hosted Power Engines.
  * Note that provided 'backboa' tool uses symmetric password-only encryption.
  * You can configure AWS Region you prefer to use and Backup Rotation policy.

  It will archive all directories required to restore your data (sites files,
  databases archives, Nginx configuration and more) on a freshly installed BOA:

    /etc /var/aegir /var/www /home /data  /data/disk/arch/sql

  It will start to run nightly at 0:15 AM (server time) only once you will add
  all required _AWS_* variables in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file and run the
  special command 'backboa install' while logged in as root.

  Full backups are scheduled on Sunday, unless _AWS_FLC is set to custom value.

  To restore any file from backups created with 'backboa' tool, you can use
  the same script on the same or any other BOA server.

  Please read below for details.


  CONFIGURATION:

  Add listed below four (4) required lines to your /root/.barracuda.cnf file.
  Required lines are marked with [R] and optional with [O]:

    _AWS_KEY='Your AWS Access Key ID'     ### [R] From your AWS S3 settings
    _AWS_SEC='Your AWS Secret Access Key' ### [R] From your AWS S3 settings
    _AWS_PWD='Your Secret Password'       ### [R] Generate with 'openssl rand -base64 32'
    _AWS_REG='Your AWS Region ID'         ### [R] By default 'us-east-1'
    _AWS_TTL='Your Backup Rotation'       ### [O] By default '30D'
    _AWS_FLC='Your Backup Full Cycle'     ### [O] By default '7D'
    _AWS_VLV='Your Backup Log Verbosity'  ### [O] By default '1'
    _AWS_PRG='Your Backup Progress'       ### [O] By default 'NO' -- can be YES/NO
    _AWS_EXB='Exclude Drush Archives'     ### [O] By default 'NO' -- can be YES/NO

    You have to use S3 Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home
    (before attempting to run initial backup!) to create S3 bucket in the
    desired region with correct name as shown below.

    Replace only the srv.foo.bar part after daily.boa. static prefix with
    your system hostname, typically displayed when you type 'uname -n'

      daily.boa.srv.foo.bar

    While duplicity should be able to create new bucket on demand, in practice
    it almost never works due to typical delays between various AWS regions.

    Please run: 'backboa test' to make sure that the connection works.

  INSTALLATION:

  $ backboa install

  USAGE:

  $ backboa backup
  $ backboa cleanup
  $ backboa list
  $ backboa status
  $ backboa test
  $ backboa restore file [time] destination
  $ backboa retrieve file [time] destination hostname

  RESTORE EXAMPLES:

  Note: Be careful while restoring not to prepend a slash to the path!

  Restoring a single file to tmp/
  $ backboa restore data/disk/o1/backups/foo.tar.gz tmp/foo.tar.gz

  Restoring an older version of a directory to tmp/ - interval or full date
  $ backboa restore data/disk/o1/backups 7D8h8s tmp/backups
  $ backboa restore data/disk/o1/backups 2014/11/11 tmp/backups

  Restoring data on a different server
  $ backboa retrieve data/disk/o1/backups/foo.tar.gz tmp/foo.tar.gz srv.foo.bar
  $ backboa retrieve data/disk/o1/backups 2014/11/11 tmp/backups srv.foo.bar

  Note: The srv.foo.bar is a hostname of the BOA system backed up before.
        In the 'retrieve' mode it will use the _AWS_* variables configured
        in the current system /root/.barracuda.cnf file - so make sure to edit
        this file to set/replace temporarily all four required _AWS_* variables
        used originally on the host you are retrieving data from! You should
        keep them secret and manage in your offline password manager app.

  Note: There is also another tool to run extra remote backups: 'duobackboa'.
        The only differences are listed below. If you wish to receive daily
        backup reports generated by 'duobackboa' via email, please add also
        _MY_EMAIL="my@email" line in the /root/.duobackboa.cnf file, if used.

        * The extra script filename and command: 'duobackboa'
        * Separate configuration file: /root/.duobackboa.cnf
        * S3 bucket naming convention: daily.remote.srv.foo.bar
        * Cron entry set to start at 5:15 AM (server time)
        * Full backups are scheduled on Saturday

        The 'duobackboa' script has also built-in how-to: just type `duobackboa`
        when logged in as system root.
