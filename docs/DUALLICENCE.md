# Dual License (Updated on April 3, 2024)

Read also: ROADMAP.txt

While all BOA code is Free/Libre Open Source, only the BOA LITE branch and Aegir itself are free of charge without limits. The BOA PRO branch will require a valid license, effective April 8, 2024.

From now on, the BOA project will be maintained in four branches:

- **LITE**: This branch remains completely free to use without any kind of license, as it was from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE). This branch should be considered as BOA LTS with slow updates, focused on both security and bug fixes, but with very limited new features additions.

- **DEV**: This branch requires a paid license for both installation and upgrade and includes the latest features, security and bug fixes, and installed services versions. This branch shouldn't be used in production without extensive testing.

- **PRO**: This branch requires a paid license and is available only as an upgrade from either LITE or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE). It includes regular monthly or bi-monthly releases, closely following the tested DEV branch.

- **OMM**: This will remain our private branch with some things we donâ€™t use removed and some added, but generally simplified for easier maintenance and modern coding standards.

The pricing will be announced shortly at [Omega8.cc Licenses](https://omega8.cc/licenses).
