### Aegir upgrade via Octopus on-demand w/o root access
###
### You can now launch Aegir upgrade to (re)install platforms listed in the file
### ~/static/control/platforms.info (see below) by creating empty pid file:
###
###   ~/static/control/run-upgrade.pid
###
### This file, if exists, will launch your Aegir upgrade in just a few minutes,
### and will be automatically deleted afterwards. This means that you can
### upgrade your Aegir instance easily to install supported platforms
### even if you don't have root access or are on hosted BOA system.
###
### Note that this pid file will be ignored if there will be no platforms.info
### file, as explained in docs/PLATFORMS.txt.
###


###
### Barracuda and Octopus upgrade on-schedule w/ root access
###
### You can launch BOA after-midnight self-upgrade, either for system only or
### also for the Aegir instances by adding supported variables to the file:
###
###   /root/.barracuda.cnf
###
### You can configure BOA to run automated upgrades to latest head version
### for both Barracuda and all Octopus instances with three variables, empty
### by default. All three variables must be defined to enable auto-upgrade.
###
### You can set _AUTO_UP_MONTH and _AUTO_UP_DAY to any date in the past or
### future (like _AUTO_UP_MONTH=2 with _AUTO_UP_DAY=29) if you wish to enable
### only weekly system upgrades.
###
### Remember that day/month upgrades will include complete upgrade to latest BOA
### head for Barracuda and all Octopus instances, while weekly upgrade is
### designed to run only 'barracuda up-lite system' upgrade.
###
### You can further modify the auto-upgrade by specifying either head or dev
### with _AUTO_VER variable, plus you can include all supported PHP versions
### with _AUTO_PHP variable set to "php-min" -- otherwise it will be ignored.
###
### Note that weekly system upgrade will start shortly after midnight on the
### specified weekday, while the day/month upgrades for both Barracuda
### and all Octopus instances will start at ~3 AM for system and Aegir Master
### instance, and ~4 AM for all Octopus based Aegir instances.
###
### NOTE: All three _AUTO_UP_* variables must be defined to enable auto-upgrade.
###
_AUTO_UP_WEEKLY= #-------------- Day of week (1-7) for weekly system upgrades
_AUTO_UP_MONTH= #--------------- Month (1-12) to define date of one-time upgrade
_AUTO_UP_DAY= #----------------- Day (1-31) to define date of one-time upgrade
_AUTO_VER=dev #----------------- The BOA version to use (dev by default)
_AUTO_PHP= #-------------------- Useful to force php-min, otherwise ignored
