# INI files templates with docs for site and platform level

```sh
  => Clarification on the user_register_protection vars/control files logic

  Instead of the previously used confusing enable/disable variables and control
  files we use correct names corresponding with the feature behaviour which is
  actually enable_strict/ignore with non-strict enable being the default mode.

  There are actually three modes available, affecting only Drupal 6 and 7 sites:

  * non-strict protection when no vars/control files are used, which by default
    switches Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 sites to 'Visitors, but administrator
    approval is required' plus 'Require email verification when a visitor
    creates an account'

  * strict protection when either var or control file of "enable_strict" type
    is used, which switches Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 sites to 'Administrators only'

  * no protection when either var or control file of "ignore" type is used,
    which simply disables the procedure altogether but doesn't modify
    any settings in the Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 sites.
```

;;  We also recommend that you enable and configure built-in session_expire
;;  module, which allows you to keep the sessions DB table tidy. Make sure that
;;  TTL set via session_cookie_ttl variable below is *lower* than TTL configured
;;  in the session_expire module, because the module does not care about PHP
;;  settings and simply deletes old entries from the sessions table on cron run.
;;
;session_cookie_ttl = 86400

;;
;;  You can control session garbage collector (EOL) per site and per platform.
;;  The value (in seconds) of the session_gc_eol variable is used as

;;        and set it to FALSE below.
;;
;;  Remember to uncomment the line below if you want to modify default settings.

;;
;;  Sometimes you may want to exclude some problematic cache bins from Redis
;;  so they will use default SQL engine, at least until related issue will be
;;  fixed either in your contrib code or in the Redis integration module.
;;
;;  Normally you had to edit the local.settings.php file which is both tedious
;;  and dangerous because of extra steps: https://omega8.cc/node/230 to add
;;  a line, for example: $conf['cache_class_cache_foo'] = 'DrupalDatabaseCache';
;;  Plus, it had to be done for every site separately.
;;
;;  Now you can simply list the cache bins to exclude below, comma separated,
;;  either in the site or platform level active INI file.
;;
;;  Example: redis_exclude_bins = "cache_form,cache_foo,cache_bar"
;;
;redis_exclude_bins = FALSE

;;

;;
;redis_cache_disable = FALSE

;;
;;  Speed Booster uses Nginx microcaching mode by default, with just 10 seconds
;;  both for anonymous visitors and logged in users. All known robots/crawlers
;;  and search engines spiders are forced to accept up to 24 hours cache TTL.
;;  Below you can modify the (10 seconds) default for human, anonymous visitors.
;;  Uncomment the line below and set any numeric value you prefer (in seconds)
;;  to override system default (10 seconds). You may want to enable Purge and
;;  Expire modules in this site modules admin area, so any new or modified node,
;;  comment added etc will selectively auto-purge related cache entries to avoid
;;  serving stale content for extended time (depending on the TTL configured).
;;  Note that the value must be higher than 10 or it will be ignored.
;;
;speed_booster_anon_cache_ttl = 10

;;
;;  With default Speed Booster TTL set to just 10 seconds to achieve the
;;  microcaching mode, disabling Drupal own page cache will significantly
;;  degrade your site's performance on every request not served via Speed
;;  Booster front-end cache, because Drupal will have to build the page from
;;  scratch every 10 seconds, making your site SLOW for every visitor not lucky
;;  enough to visit already cached page. This is why BOA enables Drupal own
;;  page cache by default, even if Boost, if used, will complain about it.
;;  It allows Drupal to keep its internal full-page cache in the super-fast
;;  Redis backend, to make also those every-10-seconds non-cached in Speed
;;  Booster requests blazingly fast.
;;
;;  If for some reason this default BOA configuration breaks something
;;  important in your site, like some page which should display not cached
;;  in a full-page cache results for anonymous visitors, even if they don't
;;  have a cookie set in the browser, didn't submit any form etc, so no other
;;  method to make the displayed page dynamic on the fly could be triggered,
;;  you could (very carefully) consider changing this variable to TRUE.
;;
;;  But please think twice before using this variable. While Redis will still
;;  improve performance for all other cache bins, the cache_page bin will
;;  not be used, and this will make your site much slower, randomly, even if
;;  you will increase the tiny speed_booster_anon_cache_ttl value above.
;;
;;  If you really have to disable this on some problematic URI, to guarantee
;;  that the page will be as dynamic as possible also for anonymous visitors,
;;  you may want to use more granular method, like adding in your site's
;;  local.settings.php file exception for the affected URI:
```

```php
;;
;;    if (preg_match("/^\/(?:foo|bar)/", $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
;;      header('X-Accel-Expires: 1'); // This disables Speed Booster
;;      $conf['cache'] = 0; // This disables page caching on the fly
;;    }

;disable_drupal_page_cache = FALSE

;;  never cached and always hit Drupal directly. Some sites may experience
;;  issues when your browser has expired session/cookie which redirects you
;;  to the homepage even if you were logged in. If something like this happens,

[system_control]
;;
;;  This option allows to activate Solr core configuration for the site.
;;
;;  Both Solr 7 and Solr 4 powered by Jetty 9 server are available. Supported
;;  integration modules are limited to latest versions of either search_api_solr
;;  (D9/Solr7, D8/Solr7 and D7/Solr7 ) or apachesolr (D7/Solr4 and D6/Solr4).
;;
;;  Currently supported versions are listed below:
;;
;;   https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/search_api_solr-4.2.6.tar.gz (D9.2+)
;;   https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/search_api_solr-4.1.12.tar.gz (D8.8+)
;;   https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/search_api_solr-7.x-1.15.tar.gz
;;   https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/apachesolr-7.x-1.12.tar.gz
;;   https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/apachesolr-6.x-3.1.tar.gz
;;
;;  Note that you still need to add preferred integration module along with
;;  any its dependencies in your codebase since this feature doesn't modify
;;  your platform or site - it only creates Solr core with configuration
;;  files provided by integration module: schema.xml and solrconfig.xml
;;
;;  Important: search_api_solr for D8+ is different from all previous versions,
;;  as it requires Composer to install the module and its dependencies, then
;;  you will need to configure it, and only then you will be able to generate
;;  customized Solr core config files, which you should upload in the path:
;;  sites/foo.com/files/solr/ and wait 5-10 minutes to have them activated
;;  on the Solr 7 core the system will create for you.
;;
;;  NOTE: You must set 'solr_custom_config = NO' for the changes to take effect.
;;
;;  This setting affects the running every 5-10 minutes auto-installer, hence
;;  no need to wait until next morning to be able to use new Solr core. Win!
;;
;;  Once the Solr core is ready to use, you will find a special file in your
;;  site directory: sites/foo.com/solr.php with details on how to access
;;  your new Solr core with correct credentials.
;;
;;  The site with enabled Solr core can be safely migrated between platforms,
;;  integration module can be moved within your codebase and even upgraded,
;;  as long as it is using compatible schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files.
;;
;;  Supported values for the solr_integration_module variable:
;;
;;    search_api_solr
;;    apachesolr
;;
;;  To delete existing Solr core simply comment out this line.
;;  The system will cleanly delete existing Solr core in 15 minutes.
;;
;solr_integration_module = your_module_name_here

;;
;;  This option allows to auto-update your Solr core configuration files:
;;
;;    schema.xml
;;    solrconfig.xml
;;
;;  If there is new release for either apachesolr or search_api_solr, your
;;  Solr core will not be automatically upgraded to use newer schema.xml and
;;  solrconfig.xml, unless allowed by switching solr_update_config to YES.
;;
;;  This option will be ignored if you will set solr_custom_config to YES.
;;
;solr_update_config = NO

;;
;;  This option allows to protect custom Solr core configuration files:
;;
;;    schema.xml
;;    solrconfig.xml
;;
;;  To use customized version of either schema.xml or solrconfig.xml, you need
;;  to switch solr_custom_config to YES below and if you are using hosted
;;  Aegir service, submit a support ticket to get these files updated with
;;  your custom versions. On self-hosted BOA simply update these files directly.
;;
;;  Please remember to use Solr compatible config files.
;;
;;  IMPORTANT! -- Please note that with this option enabled you won't be able
;;  to follow the Drupal 8+ specific procedure for search_api_solr with config
;;  files generated and uploaded to the files/solr/ directory in your site.
;;  You could still use this option to make your Solr core immutable between
;;  your upgrades, though, but you must remember about disabling this option
;;  briefly (5-10 minutes) for the changes to take effect.
;;
;solr_custom_config = NO

;;
;;  This option allows to activate and/or customize DB tables conversion mode
;;  for this site only, and the value defined here will override the value of
;;  sql_conversion_mode set in the platform level boa_platform_control.ini
;;  file located in the sites/all/modules directory.
;;
;;  It can be also set (and forced) automatically for all sites on all platforms
;;  if there is special _SQL_CONVERT variable defined for this Octopus instance
;;  in its .USER.octopus.cnf config file, but it may require submitting support
;;  request if you are using hosted Aegir BOA service without root access.
;;
;;  Supported values are: innodb and myisam (lowercase only!)
;;
;;  Note that this conversion, if enabled, will run daily even if all tables
;;  have been already converted, so it will run OPTIMIZE task on all tables,
;;  effectively.
;;
;;  This setting affects only the running daily maintenance system behaviour.
;;
;;  This option is available only in BOA-2.1.3 or newer.
;;
;sql_conversion_mode = NO

;;
;;  Registration settings are now restricted by design to protect your sites
;;  from unintended turning them into spam machines (which is allowed by
;;  Drupal 6 default settings, sadly). Spambots targeting Drupal sites are
;;  already a plague, so unless you have already set more strict permissions
;;  'Administrators only', we force reasonable default policy for new accounts
;;  registration: 'Visitors, but administrator approval is required' plus
;;  'Require email verification when a visitor creates an account' enabled.
;;  If you wish to disable email verification or set 'Who can register
;;  accounts' to 'Visitors', you must set it to TRUE below and uncomment
;;  the line. Now you will be able to permanently change these settings
;;  in this site admin area. Otherwise our default protection will be enabled
;;  again the next day (early morning in the server time zone). Note that
;;  we don't force 'Administrators only', because it could immediately break
;;  many commerce or community sites essential features. But for other sites,
;;  'Administrators only' is strongly suggested.
;;
;;  It can be set to TRUE automatically on all platforms AND all sites if
;;  there is an empty *disable* control file:
;;
;;    ~/static/control/ignore_user_register_protection.info
;;
;;  NOTE: The *disable* file will make the *enable* file IGNORED if both exist!
;;
;;    ~/static/control/enable_strict_user_register_protection.info
;;
;;  Note also that this setting affects only the maintenance system behaviour.
;;  It doesn't affect the site behaviour directly in a live mode, so you can
;;  modify related settings in the site admin, and they can be overridden,
;;  depending on the value defined below, when the maintenance system runs
;;  again -- which happens each morning.

;;  Speed Booster uses Nginx microcaching mode by default, with just 10 seconds
;;  both for anonymous visitors and logged in users. All known robots/crawlers
;;  and search engines spiders are forced to accept up to 24 hours cache TTL.
;;  Below you can modify the (10 seconds) default for human, anonymous visitors.
;;  Uncomment the line below and set any numeric value you prefer (in seconds)
;;  to override system default (10 seconds). You may want to enable Purge and
;;  Expire modules in all sites on this platform, so any new or modified node,
;;  comment added etc will selectively auto-purge related cache entries to avoid
;;  serving stale content for extended time (depending on the TTL configured).
;;  Note that the value must be higher than 10 or it will be ignored.
;;
;speed_booster_anon_cache_ttl = 10

;;
;;  With default Speed Booster TTL set to just 10 seconds to achieve the
;;  microcaching mode, disabling Drupal own page cache will significantly
;;  degrade your site's performance on every request not served via Speed
;;  Booster front-end cache, because Drupal will have to build the page from
;;  scratch every 10 seconds, making your site SLOW for every visitor not lucky
;;  enough to visit already cached page. This is why BOA enables Drupal own
;;  page cache by default, even if Boost, if used, will complain about it.
;;  It allows Drupal to keep its internal full-page cache in the super-fast
;;  Redis backend, to make also those every-10-seconds non-cached in Speed
;;  Booster requests blazingly fast.
;;
;;  If for some reason this default BOA configuration breaks something
;;  important in your site, like some page which should display not cached
;;  in a full-page cache results for anonymous visitors, even if they don't
;;  have a cookie set in the browser, didn't submit any form etc, so no other
;;  method to make the displayed page dynamic on the fly could be triggered,
;;  you could (very carefully) consider changing this variable to TRUE.
;;
;;  But please think twice before using this variable. While Redis will still
;;  improve performance for all other cache bins, the cache_page bin will
;;  not be used, and this will make your site much slower, randomly, even if
;;  you will increase the tiny speed_booster_anon_cache_ttl value above.
;;
;;  If you really have to disable this on some problematic URI, to guarantee
;;  that the page will be as dynamic as possible also for anonymous visitors,
;;  you may want to use more granular method, like adding in your site's
;;  local.settings.php file exception for the affected URI:
;;
;;    if (preg_match("/^\/(?:foo|bar)/", $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
;;      header('X-Accel-Expires: 1'); // This disables Speed Booster
;;      $conf['cache'] = 0; // This disables page caching on the fly
;;    }
