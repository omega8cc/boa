### How to migrate single sites between remote Aegir instances
#
# This is detailed how-to for remote_import Provision extension
# and hosting_remote_import module included by default in every
# Aegir Satellite Instance since BOA-2.0.3 Edition.
#
# We assume that your Octopus system user is default o1.
#
# Important: the system user must be the same on source and
# target, since Aegir doesn't allow (yet) to migrate from o1
# to o2, only from o1 to o1 or from o2 to o2, etc.
#
# The 'source-host' is a placeholder for your source instance FQDN hostname.
# The 'target-host' is a placeholder for your target instance FQDN hostname.
# The 'plform-name' is a placeholder for the name of the imported codebase root directory.
#
# Caveats:
#
# 1. The ajax_comments contrib module must be disabled and removed before site migration.
# 2. The Verify task on the migrated site must run w/o errors before migration.
#
# You need to run required commands and perform tasks in the order listed below:

### Commands to run on both source and target server
#
$ chsh -s /bin/bash o1
$ sed -i "s/^max_execution_time =.*/max_execution_time = 7200/g" /opt/php*/lib/php.ini
$ sed -i "s/^max_input_time =.*/max_input_time = 7200/g"         /opt/php*/lib/php.ini

### Commands to run on the source server only
#
$ su - o1
$ nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ### Paste ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from the same account on target
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*

### Commands to run on the target server only
#
$ su - o1
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa -H source-host >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
$ drush @hostmaster en hosting_remote_import -y
$ rsync -avzuL --exclude=plform-name/sites --ignore-errors -e ssh o1@source-host:/path/to/plform-name ~/static/
$ mkdir -p ~/static/plform-name/sites
$ rsync -avzuL --ignore-errors -e ssh o1@source-host:/path/to/plform-name/sites/all ~/static/plform-name/sites/
$ rsync -avzuL --ignore-errors -e ssh o1@source-host:/path/to/plform-name/sites/default ~/static/plform-name/sites/
#
# Add the transfered platform codebase in the Aegir frontend
# with path: /data/disk/o1/static/plform-name

### Commands to run on the source server only
#
$ mv -f /var/xdrago/manage_ltd_users.sh /var/backups/
$ service clean-boa-env start

### Tasks to perform on the target server only
#
# Note: you will have to wait for cron to run after every step or run
# the tasks cron manually with `bash /var/xdrago/run-o1`
#
1. Go to /node/add/server in the Aegir control panel on the target instance
2. Enter FQDN of the source server as a 'Server hostname'
3. Choose only 'hostmaster' option under 'Remote Import' and hit 'Save'
4. Go to 'Import remote sites' tab on the just added server node once verified
5. Click on the "Retrieve a list..." button and run cron
6. Choose the site to import from the list and hit 'Next'
7. Choose the platform the site should be hosted on, hit 'Import' and run cron
8. Wait... wait.. wait.. until it is done and the site is imported and verified
#
# Repeat steps 4-8 to migrate next/more site(s)

### Commands to run on the source server only
#
$ mv -f  /var/backups/manage_ltd_users.sh /var/xdrago/

### Commands to run on both source and target server
#
$ chsh -s /bin/false o1
