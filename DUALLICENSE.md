# Dual License and BOA branches explained

While all **BOA** code is **Free/Libre Open Source**, only the **BOA LTS** branch and **Ægir** itself are free of charge without limits.

- **LTS**: This public branch remains completely free to use without any kind of commercial license, as it was from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE). This branch should be considered as **BOA Long Term Support** variant with slow updates, focused on both security and bug fixes, but with very limited new features additions.

- **DEV**: This public branch requires a commercial license for both installation and upgrade and includes the latest features, security and bug fixes, and installed services versions. This branch shouldn't be used in production without extensive testing.

- **PRO**: This public branch requires a commercial license and is available only as an upgrade from either LTS or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE). It offers new releases once ready, closely following the tested DEV branch.

- **OMM**: This private branch is managed separately with some things we don’t use removed and some added, but generally simplified for easier maintenance and modern coding standards.

You can install only **BOA LTS**, then upgrade to **PRO** with a license from [Omega8.cc](https://omega8.cc/licenses) once available.
