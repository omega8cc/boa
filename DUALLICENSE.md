# Dual License and BOA Branches Explained

While all **BOA** code is **Free/Libre Open Source**, only the **BOA LTS** branch and **Ã†gir** itself are free of charge without limits.

- **LTS**: This public branch remains completely free to use without any commercial license, as it has been from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE). This branch should be considered the **BOA Long Term Support** variant with slow updates, focused on security and bug fixes, with very limited new feature additions.

- **DEV**: This public branch requires a commercial license for both installation and upgrades. It includes the latest features, security and bug fixes, and updated service versions. This branch should not be used in production without extensive testing.

- **PRO**: This public branch requires a commercial license and is available only as an upgrade from either LTS or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE). It offers new releases once ready, closely following the tested DEV branch.

- **OMM**: This private branch is managed separately, with some unused components removed and others added. It is generally simplified for easier maintenance and adheres to modern coding standards.

You can install only **BOA LTS** and then upgrade to **PRO** with a license from [Omega8.cc](https://omega8.cc/licenses) once available.
