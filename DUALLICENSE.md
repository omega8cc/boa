# Dual License and BOA Branches Explained

## BOA Continues to be a Free/Libre Open Source Project

While 100% of **BOA** code is **Free/Libre Open Source**, only the **BOA LTS** branch and **Ægir** itself are available free of charge without limits.

- **LTS**: This public branch remains completely free to use without any commercial license, as it has been from the beginning (previously named HEAD or STABLE). This branch should be considered the **BOA Long Term Support** variant, with slow updates focused on security and bug fixes, and limited new features.

- **DEV**: This public branch requires a commercial license for both installation and upgrades. It includes the latest features, security updates, bug fixes, and updated service versions. This branch should not be used in production without extensive testing.

- **PRO**: This public branch requires a commercial license and is available only as an upgrade from either LTS or DEV (or previous HEAD/STABLE). It offers new releases once ready, closely following the tested DEV branch.

- **OMM**: This private branch is managed separately, with some unused components removed and others added. It is generally simplified for easier maintenance and adheres to modern coding standards.

You can install only **BOA LTS** and then upgrade to **PRO** with a license from [Omega8.cc](https://omega8.cc/licenses) once available.

## Practical Differences Between **LTS** and **PRO**

Over time, **PRO** will be ahead of **LTS** as its name suggests.

The `BOA-5.3.0` release will be the last parallel release including all features developed in **DEV**, so both **PRO** and **LTS** users will enjoy the same extensive list of improvements, bug fixes, and new features. There are too many key features developed in **DEV** not to include them in the good and reliable **LTS** version for everyone.

In the future, new features will be regularly added to **PRO**, while **LTS** will receive only security updates and critical fixes. There may be exceptions, and some new features may find their way to **LTS**, but only as exceptions.

The **PRO** will be available in three main variants, and while all **PRO** licenses will grant access to the same **BOA** branch and features, they will differ in terms of available support levels.

### **PRO** with **Basic Support**

This license is designed for **BOA** users familiar with managing and monitoring their own systems who don't need extended support, monitoring, or assistance in managing their **BOA** installation and updates. Our support is limited to the Issue Queue on GitHub without any kind of SLA or Best Effort guarantee.

### **PRO** with **Advanced Support**

This license is designed for **BOA** users who are familiar with managing their own server but need assistance in handling their custom needs or fixing individual problems privately via our helpdesk at [Ægir Helpdesk](https://aegir.happyfox.com), without posting details on GitHub. There is no SLA guarantee, only a Best Effort guarantee. System local and remote uptime monitoring with Site24x7 is included.

### **PRO** with **Hands-Off Experience**

This license is for **BOA** users who prefer to delegate all the work needed to maintain their **BOA** server, including regular upgrades (both **BOA** and major OS upgrades), active monitoring, and responding to DoS incidents. It comes with a fully managed **BOA PRO** installation you can use without worrying about anything else, with our general SLA guarantee applied: [Omega8.cc SLA](https://omega8.cc/sla). System local and remote uptime monitoring with Site24x7 is included.

You can obtain a **BOA PRO** license from [Omega8.cc](https://omega8.cc/licenses) once available.
